Results of panel regression analyses indicate that within less-developed countries, industrial water pollution is positively associated with FDI in the manufacturing sector. However, a stronger presence of environmental international nongovernmental organizations and the existence of environmental ministries both attenuate the environmental harms of secondary sector foreign investment, whereas state strength appears to have no such mitigating influence. These findings lend support to investment dependence theory and world society theory, and illustrate the potential environmental benefits of particular institutional factors. Further analyses suggest that industrial water pollution contributes to child and infant mortality in less-developed countries, which highlights the importance of investigating the structural determinants of industrial-based pollutants.},

Further analyses investigate the impact of organic water pollution on infant mortality rates in less-developed countries. In general, findings for Prais-Winsten regression analyses with panel-corrected standard errors and generalized least squares panel regression analyses of less-developed countries confirm the tested hypotheses, and indicate that industrial organic water pollution intensity does indeed contribute to infant mortality, net of the effects of economic development, fertility rates, health expenditures and other relevant factors.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: The mortality numbers and rates of chronic disease are rising faster in developing than in developed countries. This article compares prevailing explanations of population chronic disease trends with theoretical and empirical models of population chronic disease epidemiology and assesses some economic consequences of the growth of chronic diseases in developing countries based on the experiences of developed countries. METHODS: Four decades of male mortality rates of cardiovascular and chronic noncommunicable diseases were regressed on changes in and levels of country income per capita, market integration, foreign direct investment, urbanization rates, and population aging in fifty-six countries for which comparative data were available. Neoclassical economic growth models were used to estimate the effect of the mortality rates of chronic noncommunicable diseases on economic growth in high-income OECD countries. FINDINGS: Processes of economic growth, market integration, foreign direct investment, and urbanization were significant determinants of long-term changes in mortality rates of heart disease and chronic noncommunicable disease, and the observed relationships with these social and economic factors were roughly three times stronger than the relationships with the population's aging. In low-income countries, higher levels of country income per capita, population urbanization, foreign direct investment, and market integration were associated with greater mortality rates of heart disease and chronic noncommunicable disease, less increased or sometimes reduced rates in middle-income countries, and decreased rates in high-income countries. Each 10 percent increase in the working-age mortality rates of chronic noncommunicable disease decreased economic growth rates by close to a half percent. CONCLUSIONS: Macrosocial and macroeconomic forces are major determinants of population rises in chronic disease mortality, and some prevailing demographic explanations, such as population aging, are incomplete on methodological, empirical, and policy grounds. Rising chronic disease mortality rates will significantly reduce economic growth in developing countries and further widen the health and economic gap between the developed and developing world.},

The second challenge is a legal capacity challenge that concerns the ability of States to identify their rights and obligations under international trade and investment agreements. These highly specialized areas of law present capacity challenges for many States, and these challenges are amplified where trade and health intersect. There is also no universal solution to this problem. There is a clear need for capacity building, but there may also be merit in the provision of more specialized assistance to States on a case-bycase basis.},

However, there has not been a meta-analysis of the prevalence of childhood and adolescent overweight/obesity in China during the past 30 years. METHODS: The China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang DATA, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature were searched for relevant studies published between January 1970 and June 2012. The prevalence of overweight/obesity over time was pooled using Stata/SE, version 9. Summary statistics (odds ratios, ORs) were used to compare sex-specific and urban-rural preponderance of overweight/obesity using Review Manager. RESULTS: After screening 1326 papers, we included 35 papers (41 studies), most of medium quality. The prevalence of overweight/obesity increased from 1.8\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.4\%-3.1\%) and 0.4\% (95\% CI, -0.1\% to -0.8\%) respectively in 1981-1985 to 13.1\% (95\% CI, 11.2\%-15.0\%) and 7.5\% (95\% CI, 6.6\%-8.4\%) respectively in 2006-2010. The average annual increase was 8.3\% and 12.4\% respectively. Boys were more likely to be overweight/obese than girls (OR, 1.36; 95\% CI, 1.24-1.49 and OR, 1.68; 95\% CI, 1.52-1.86 respectively). The prevalence of overweight/obesity was higher in urban areas than in rural areas (OR, 1.66; 95\% CI, 1.54-1.79 and OR, 1.97; 95\% CI, 1.68-2.30 respectively). For age-specific subgroup analyses, both overweight and obesity increased more rapidly in the toddler stage than in other developmental stages. Sensitivity analyses showed that sample-size differences, study quality, overweight/obesity criteria and geographical distribution affected overweight/obesity prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Toddlers and urban boys were at particularly high risk; the prevalence in these groups increased more rapidly than in their counterparts. Public health prevention strategies are urgently needed to modify health behaviors of children and adolescents and control overweight/obesity in China.},

	abstract = {This paper poses three main questions. Who is investing in Russia? Foreign investment is dominated by companies from the US and EU, plus countries such as Cyprus and Switzerland which represent returning Russian flight capital. Which sectors of the economic are benefiting from such investment? Initial investment flows were dominated by market-oriented investment in Moscow city and investment in the resource regions; post 1998 financial crisis, there is evidence of import substituting investment in consumer oriented sectors, most notably the food industry. Which regions are the major recipients of investment? The shift in motivation after 1998 brought with it the acceleration of a trend towards investment beyond Moscow city. That said, FDI remains highly concentrated in a relatively small number of regions. Many of those same regions also represent some of Russia's most developed regions, they are the regions at the top of the various investment ratings (such as those conducted by Ekspert Magazine (2001)) and they have also been the major recipients of Western technical assistance. Thus one can conclude that foreign investment activity, together with other forms of internationalisation, is amplifying existing regional inequalities. It is certainly the case that large parts of Russian territory remain untouched by increased interaction with the global economy.},

Especially, the unpredictability of laws, regulations and policies, excessive regulatory burden, government instability and lack of commitment play a major role in deterring FDI. For example, the effect of a one standard devia- tion improvement in the regulatory quality of the host country increases FDI by a factor of around 2.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: International comparisons can provide clues to understanding some of the important policy-related determinants of health, including those related to the provision of health care services. An earlier study indicated that the strength of the primary care infrastructure of a health services system might be related to overall costs of health services. The purpose of the current research was to determine the robustness of the findings in the light of the passage of 5-10 years, the addition of two more countries, and the findings of other research on the possible importance of other determinants of country health levels. METHODS: Thirteen industrialized countries, all with populations of at least 5 million, were characterized by the relative strength of their primary care infrastructure, the degree of national income inequality, and a major manifestation of a behavioral determinant of health that is amenable to policy intervention (smoking), using international data sets and national informants. Health system and primary care practice characteristics were judged according to pre-set criteria. Major indicators of health were used as dependent variables, as were health care costs. FINDINGS: The stronger the primary care, the lower the costs. Countries with very weak primary care infrastructures have poorer performance on major aspects of health. Although countries that are intermediate in the strength of their primary care generally have levels of health at least as good as those with high levels of primary care, this is not the case in early life, when the impact of strong primary care is greatest. A subset of characteristics (equitable distribution of resources, publicly accountable universal financial coverage, low cost sharing, comprehensive services, and family-oriented services) distinguishes countries with overall good health from those with poor health at all ages. Neither income inequality nor smoking status accurately identified those countries with either consistently high or consistently poor performance on the health indicators. Interpretation: A certain level of health care expenditures may be required to achieve overall good health levels, even in the presence of strong primary care infrastructures. Very low costs may interfere with achievement of good health, particularly at older ages, although very high levels of costs may signal excessive and potentially health-compromising care. Five policy-relevant characteristics appear to be related to better population health levels. There is no consistent relationship between income inequality, smoking, and health levels as measured by various indicators of health in different age groups.},

	abstract = {Cancer remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is predicted that by 2020, the number of new cases of cancer in the world will increase to more than 15 million, with deaths increasing to 12 million. Much of the burden of cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality will occur in the developing world. This forms part of a larger epidemiological transition in which the burden of chronic, non-communicable disease-once limited to industrialized nations-is now increasing in less developed countries. In addition to the accumulating risks associated with diet, tobacco, alcohol, lack of exercise, and industrial exposures, the developing world is already burdened by cancers some of which are attributable to infectious diseases. These disparities in cancer risk combined with poor access to epidemiological data, research, treatment, and cancer control and prevention combine to result in significantly poorer survival rates in developing countries for a range of specific malignancies. This paper summarizes the recent trends in the epidemiology and survival of cancers in the developing and developed world, and explores potential causes and policy responses to the disproportionate and growing cancer burden in less developed countries. Such responses may include raising awareness as well as education and training to foster better informed decision-making, together with improved cancer surveillance, early detection and emphasis on prevention. Improved health care financing and international initiatives and/or partnerships could also provide additional impetus in targeting resources where needed urgently.},

	abstract = {Objective: To examine the role of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the nutrition transition, focusing on highly processed foods. Design: Data on FDI were identified from reports/databases and then compiled and analysed, A review of published literature on FDI into the food sector was conducted. Setting: The nutrition transition is a public health concern owing to its connection with the rising burden of obesity and diet-related chronic diseases in developing countries. Global health leaders are calling for action to address the threat. Highly processed foods often have considerable fat, Sugar and salt content, and warrant closer examination. Results: FDI into food processing, service and retail has risen rapidly since the 1980s, mainly from transnational food companies (TFCs) in developed countries. As FDI has risen, so has the proportion invested in highly processed foods for sale in the host market. FDI has proved more effective than trade in generating sales of highly processed foods, and enables TFCs to cut costs, gain market power and obtain efficiencies in distribution and marketing. The amount of FDI targeted at developing countries is increasing; while a disproportionate share enters the larger developing economies, foreign affiliates of TFCs are among the largest companies in low- and low- to middle-income countries. The effect of FDI is to make more highly processed foods available to more people. FDI has made it possible to lower prices, open Lip new purchasing channels, optimise the effectiveness of marketing and advertising, and increase sales. Conclusion: FDI has been a key mechanism in shaping the global market for highly processed foods. Notwithstanding the role of demand-side factors, it has played a role in the nutrition transition by enabling and promoting the consumption of these foods in developing countries. Empirical data on consumption patterns of highly processed foods in developing countries are critically needed, but since FDI is a long-term investment vehicle, it is reasonable to assume that availability and consumption of highly processed foods will continue to increase. FDI can, however, bring considerable benefits as well as risks. Through its position 'upstream', FDI would therefore be an appropriate entry-point to implement a range of public health policies to 'redirect' the nutrition transition.},

It is particularly important in view of the way the tobacco industry has targeted this region since transition. A nationally representative household survey designed to explore smoking behaviour and its determinants was undertaken in Belarus in April 2000. Data were available on 1090 individuals aged 18 years and over (response rate 53.4\%). Respondents were similar demographically to the population of Belarus. Fifty three percent of men and 9\% of women are current smokers and an additional 18\% and 7\% respectively are ex-smokers. Differences in smoking habits between successive generations were identified. These included a ninefold higher rate of ever-smoking amongst 18-29 years old women compared with those aged over 60 years (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.0001) and a higher proportion of current smokers starting in childhood amongst those aged 18-29 years compared with older smokers (p = 0.0005). Smoking in public places, particularly the workplace where 65\% smoke, is common. Smokers are more likely than non-smokers to have positive beliefs about the health impact of active and passive smoking (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.0001). Amongst women the odds of smoking is 13 times higher in those living in large cities compared with those living in villages. In men, disadvantage and a positive attitude to the west appear to increase the likelihood of smoking. To date policy responses have been inadequate. Unless effective tobacco control policies are introduced, tobacco will continue to make an increasingly large contribution to premature morbidity and mortality in Belarus.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To quantify the contribution the tobacco industry has made to foreign direct investment (FDI) in the former Soviet Union (FSU) as an indicator of its political and economic leverage; to explore the impact this has had on production capacity and tobacco control in the region. DESIGN: Data on industry investment and its impact on cigarette production capacity were collated from industry journals, reports, and websites. Data on total FDI were obtained from the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. RESULTS: By the end of 2000, transnational tobacco companies (TTCs) had invested over 2.7 billion US dollars in 10 countries of the FSU. Tobacco money as a proportion of FDI varies from 1\% to over 30\% in Uzbekistan. Cigarette production capacity in the factories receiving investments tripled from 146 to 416 billion cigarettes per annum and the TTCs' market share has increased from nothing to between 50-100\% in the markets in which they invested. Findings suggest that the effectiveness of national tobacco control measures corresponds broadly to the nature of the political and economic transition in each country and the size of industry investment, which is determined in part by the political context. Thus more effective measures tend to be seen in democratic states with smaller or no industry investments while the least effective measures are seen in highly centralised, one party states with high levels of industry investment or those with limited governmental capacity. CONCLUSIONS: The entry of the TTCs at a time of major political and economic change left the FSU particularly vulnerable to industry influence. This influence was enhanced by the industry's significant contribution to FDI, their ability to take over existing state monopolies in all but the largest countries, and the lack of democratic opposition.},

This study describes the geographic variation in BMI levels and the prevalence of overweight and underweight in Chinese adults, and assesses their relations with regional Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita levels. BMI values and the prevalence of overweight and underweight in 143 522 adults from the Chinese National Nutrition and Health Survey (2002) were calculated according to geographic regions in China. Their correlations with GDP were assessed. Linear and logistic regressions were used to adjust for age, sex and city-country composition. BMI and the prevalence of overweight were highest in the Bohai coastal regions while lowest in southern provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Hunan and Fujian. Mean BMI values ranged from 20.72 to 25.48 kg/m2, and the prevalence of overweight ranged from 6.6 to 53.9 \%. BMI and the prevalence of overweight were positively correlated with economic development, particularly in the northern regions. However, for regions with similar GDP per capita levels, those in the south had substantially lower BMI and lower prevalence of overweight than those in the north. Interestingly, some southern regions with high GDP per capita had low BMI and low prevalence of overweight. The prevalence of underweight was highest in the south. Substantial geographic variations in the prevalence of overweight and underweight exist in China. Such variations cannot be fully explained by the differences in economic status. China is currently facing challenges of both overweight and underweight but priorities vary in different regions.},

However, the effectiveness of BITs in inducing higher FDI inflows is still open to debate. It is in several ways that we attempt to clarify the inconclusive empirical findings of earlier studies. We cover a much larger sample of host and source countries by drawing on an extensive data set on bilateral FDI flows. Furthermore, we account for unilateral FDI liberalization, in order not to overestimate the effect of BITs, as well as for the potential endogeneity of BITs. Employing a gravity-type model and various model specifications, including an instrumental variable approach, we find that BITs do promote FDI flows to developing countries. BITs may even substitute for weak domestic institutions, though probably not for unilateral capital account liberalization. \textcopyright{} 2010 Kiel Institute.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries are currently experiencing one of the most rapid epidemiological transitions characterized by increasing urbanization and changing lifestyle factors. This has resulted in an increase in the incidence of non-communicable diseases, especially cardiovascular disease (CVD). This double burden of communicable and chronic non-communicable diseases has long-term public health impact as it undermines healthcare systems. PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to explore the socio-cultural context of CVD risk prevention and treatment in sub-Saharan Africa. We discuss risk factors specific to the SSA context, including poverty, urbanization, developing healthcare systems, traditional healing, lifestyle and socio-cultural factors. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a search on African Journals On-Line, Medline, PubMed, and PsycINFO databases using combinations of the key country/geographic terms, disease and risk factor specific terms such as "diabetes and Congo" and "hypertension and Nigeria". Research articles on clinical trials were excluded from this overview. Contrarily, articles that reported prevalence and incidence data on CVD risk and/or articles that report on CVD risk-related beliefs and behaviors were included. Both qualitative and quantitative articles were included. RESULTS: The epidemic of CVD in SSA is driven by multiple factors working collectively. Lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise and smoking contribute to the increasing rates of CVD in SSA. Some lifestyle factors are considered gendered in that some are salient for women and others for men. For instance, obesity is a predominant risk factor for women compared to men, but smoking still remains mostly a risk factor for men. Additionally, structural and system level issues such as lack of infrastructure for healthcare, urbanization, poverty and lack of government programs also drive this epidemic and hampers proper prevention, surveillance and treatment efforts. CONCLUSION: Using an African-centered cultural framework, the PEN3 model, we explore future directions and efforts to address the epidemic of CVD risk in SSA.},

	abstract = {With the failure of foreign aid and similar development projects, many analysts are saying that poor countries should lust free up their economies and let markets do the work. The Heritage Foundation's 1997 Index of Economic Freedom expands on this line of reasoning in a survey of government intervention and economic development. In his review, Harvard Business School Professor Bruce Scott contends that although some of the Inner's claims make sense, the editors have mistaken the chain of causation in many cases. Governments in South Korea and Taiwan, for example, liberalized only after their heavy-handed actions brought their economies a degree of prosperity. Similarly, Great Britain converted to a free-trade regime in the nineteenth century only after gaining commercial supremacy under protectionism. Some freedoms, such as an internal market without barriers, promote economic development, but free trade for a developing country can actually get in the way. The Index also insists that people concerned about their economic future should care only about their nation's sustainable growth. But people's priorities change as their incomes rise. As citizens become affluent, they are likely to accept the trade-off between higher growth and the security that government programs provide. They often care about social fairness and begin to press governments to address the widening gap between rich and poor. It is not clear that the magic of the marketplace can take care of everything. Citizens still need government for some things - and a broader framework of analysis than the Index for tackling economic choices.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The goal of this paper is to explore the hypothesis that the nutrition transition is related to households having an underweight and an overweight member simultaneously (under/over households and under/over pairs). DESIGN: The 1993 China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) was used to test the association between being an under/over household and household characteristics related to the nutrition transition. Sociodemographic and diet patterns were tested for the main age combinations of the under/over pairs. SETTING: In China, 8.1\% of all households were found to have underweight and overweight members within the same household. SUBJECTS: Results are from the 1993 China Health and Nutrition Survey and are based on a sample of 13814 persons from 3340 households. RESULTS: The under/over household was more urban, had a higher income and was more likely to have assets such as a television, a motor vehicle and a washing machine, even after controlling for sociodemographic confounders. The under/over household had a diet that was higher in fat and protein compared with the underweight and normal weight households. There were no significant differences between the under/over and overweight households, with many of the associations near unity. Comparisons of the under/over subgroups by age of the under/over pairs showed some differences by income and occupation, but not for diet. CONCLUSIONS: It is imperative, as more individuals become exposed to the diet and lifestyle patterns of the nutrition transition, to find effective public health programmes that can simultaneously promote a healthy lifestyle, improve diet quality and address both undernutrition and chronic disease.},

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: A cohort of 752,283 Swedish men born from 1952 to 1973 were followed in registers with respect to attainment of high education ({\textbackslash}textgreateror=15 years of education) until December 31, 2001. Intelligence and BMI (kilograms per meter squared) were measured at compulsory military conscription at age 18 years. Ninth grade school marks were available for a subgroup born from 1972 to 1973 (N = 93,374). The hazard ratio for attaining high education was estimated with proportional hazard regression analysis controlling for intelligence, height, parental socioeconomic position, country of birth, conscription center, and municipality. RESULTS: Young men who were obese (BMI {\textbackslash}textgreateror= 30) at age 18 years (N = 10,782) had a much lower chance of attaining a high education than normal-weight subjects [(18.5 {\textbackslash}textlessor= BMI {\textbackslash}textless 25); adjusted hazard ratio 0.48 (95\% confidence interval, 0.45, 0.52)]. Young men who were obese at age 18 had lower mean ninth grade school marks than young men with normal weight at any given intelligence level. DISCUSSION: Obese men in Sweden are doing much worse in the educational system than their normal-weight counterparts even after adjustments for intelligence and parental socioeconomic position. Discrimination in the educational system and other sectors of the society may explain these strong associations.},

METHODS: We used Poisson regression analysis of data from the Chinese National Maternal and Child Health Routine Reporting System between 2000 and 2005 to identify time trends in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) by province and region. FINDINGS: The MMR declined by an average of 5\% per year (crude relative risk, RR: 0.95; 95\% confidence interval, CI: 0.94-0.97). There was no interaction between region and year (P = 0.2311). Mortality declined by 5\% per year in the eastern region (crude RR: 0.95; 95\% CI: 0.92-0.97), by 5\% per year in the central region (crude RR; 0.95; 95\% CI: 0.94-0.96), and by 4\% per year in the western region (crude RR: 0.96; 95\% CI: 0.94-0.98). The absolute difference in MMR between the western and eastern regions declined from 65.4 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 49.4 per 100,000 live births in 2005.

Based on age- and sex-specific BMI cut-points recommended for international use, the prevalence rates of overweight and underweight in the transition from childhood to adulthood (age 6-18) were also predicted. Sex, family income, rural-urban residency and geographical location were found to be significantly associated with the onsets, slopes, and acceleration of age trajectories in BMI, overweight, and underweight (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.01). Children who had lower prevalence of underweight in the transition from childhood to adulthood exhibited higher prevalence of overweight than their counterparts. Moreover, the age interval during which children were more vulnerable to an increase in underweight was different from that for overweight. There were substantial regional disparities in the age trajectories of childhood overweight and underweight. Whereas the analyses suggest that the dual burden of nutritional problems (the coexistence of overweight and underweight) in China, is more like two sides of a coin than two separate health issues; the critical age period for intervening in childhood overweight is different from that of childhood underweight. Geographical indicators of childhood obesity in China deserve further attention.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Increasing educational attainment around the world is one of the key aims of the Millennium Development Goals. Cash transfer programs, both conditional and unconditional, are a popular social protection tool in developing countries that aim, among other things, to improve education outcomes in developing countries. The debate over whether these programs should include conditions has been at the forefront of recent global policy discussions. This systematic review aims to complement the existing evidence on the effectiveness of these programs in improving schooling outcomes and help inform the debate surrounding the design of cash transfer programs. OBJECTIVES Our main objective was to assess the relative effectiveness of conditional and unconditional cash transfers in improving enrollment, attendance and test scores in developing countries. Our secondary objective was to understand the role of different dimensions of the cash transfer programs, particularly the role of the intensity of conditions and the effects of priming (with respect to the importance of children's schooling) in cash transfer programs. SEARCH STRATEGY Five main strategies were used to identify relevant reports: (1) Electronic searches of 37 international databases (concluded on 18 April 2012), (2) contacted researchers working in the area, (3) hand searched key journals, (4) reviewed websites of relevant organizations, and (5) given the year delay between the original search and the final edits of the review we updated our references with all new eligible references the study team was aware of as of 30 April 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA To be eligible for this review, studies had to either assess the impact of a conditional cash transfer program (CCT), with at least one condition explicitly related to schooling, or evaluate an unconditional cash transfer program (UCT). The report had to include at least one quantifiable measure of enrollment, attendance or test scores. The report had to be published after 1997, utilize a randomized control trial or a quasi-experimental design, and take place in a developing country. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS A data extraction sheet was constructed to collect data on impacts and characteristics of the report and intervention. Enrollment and attendance were coded using odds ratios, while test scores were coded using standardized mean differences. Effect sizes were synthesized and summarized within and across reports to one effect size per outcome for each study. Given the heterogeneity of true effects in the population, analyses of effect sizes were estimated using random effects models. Moderator analysis was conducted with six additional variables. RESULTS The sample includes 75 reports, with data from 35 studies, including five UCTs, 26 CCTs, and four studies that directly compare CCTs to UCTs. Our findings suggest that both CCTs (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.41, 95\% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.27-1.56) and UCTs (OR 1.23, 95\% CI 1.08-1.41) have a significant effect on enrollment. These results indicate that CCTs increase the odds of a child being enrolled in school by 41\% and UCTs increase the odds by 23\%. We do not find a significant difference when comparing CCTs to UCTs (OR 1.15, 95\% CI 0.94-1.42]. The binary categorization of these programs into CCT vs. UCT ignores the fact that there is a great deal of variation in the intensity of the conditionality. If we instead group the conditionality variable into three broader categories (i) no schooling conditions (intensity=1 or 2), (ii) some schooling conditions with no enforcement or monitoring (intensity=3 or 4) and (iii) explicit schooling conditions monitored and enforced (intensity=5 or 6) we find odds ratios as follows: 1.18 (95\% CI 1.05-1.33), 1.25 (95\% CI 1.10-1.42), and 1.60 (95\% 1.37-1.88), respectively. The 95\% CI for studies with no conditions and studies with conditions monitored and enforced do not overlap. Meta-regression indicates that outside of the intensity of the conditions imposed, none of the other measured design elements have a significant effect on moderating the overall effect size. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Our main finding is that both CCTs and UCTs improve the odds of being enrolled in and attending school compared to no cash transfer program. The effect sizes for enrollment and attendance are always larger for CCT programs compared to UCT programs but the difference is not significant. When programs are categorized as having no schooling conditions, having some conditions with minimal monitoring and enforcement, and having explicit conditions that are monitored and enforced, a much clearer pattern emerges. While interventions with no conditions or some conditions that are not monitored have some effect on enrollment rates (18-25\% improvement in odds of being enrolled in school), programs that are explicitly conditional, monitor compliance and penalize non-compliance have substantively larger effects (60\% improvement in odds of enrollment). Unlike enrollment and attendance, the effectiveness of cash transfer programs on improving test scores is small at best. More research is needed that looks at longer term outcomes such as test scores, as well as on evaluating UCTs more generally.},

In 2001, there were 7.3 million deaths due to CHD worldwide. Three-fourths of global deaths due to CHD occurred in the low- and middle-income countries. The rapid rise in CHD burden in most of the low- and middle-income countries is due to socio-economic changes, increase in lifespan, and acquisition of lifestyle-related risk factors. The CHD death rate, however, varies dramatically across the developing countries. The varying incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates reflect the different levels of risk factors, other competing causes of death, availability of resources to combat cardiovascular disease, and the stage of epidemiologic transition that each country or region finds itself. The economic burden of CHD is equally large but solutions exist to manage this growing burden.},

Our new tests may be viewed as computationally simple and robust alternatives to some existing procedures in spatial econometrics. We provide empirical illustrations to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed tests. The finite sample size and power performance of the tests are also investigated through a Monte Carlo study. The results indicate that the adjusted LM tests have good finite sample properties. In addition, they prove to be more suitable for the identification of the source of dependence (lag or error) than their unadjusted counterparts.},

RESULTS: With the advent of comparative political stability in the early 1990s, BAT was quick to explore the possibilities for investment. The Cambodian government urgently required foreign investment, offering inducements and assistance to investors. In developing a joint venture, BAT saw a cost effective opportunity to dominate the local market and to defend its regional interests, Cambodia being viewed as strategically located to support smuggling. Given minimal advertising regulation, BATC have undertaken wide ranging promotions and sought to prevent advances in tobacco control. CONCLUSIONS: BATC is presented as a contribution to Cambodia's regeneration, but the documents highlight its exploitation of state incapacity and an escalating threat to public health.},

Since 1998, it appears the importance of big cities, the Sakhalin region, oil and gas resources, proximity to European markets, and legislation and political risks has increased. Our results also reveal a shift from horizontal FDI strategy to vertical FDI strategy in the post-crisis period.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: China was one of the 68 "countdown" countries prioritized to attain Millennium Development Goals (MDG 4). The aim of this study was to analyze data on child survival and health care coverage of proven cost-effective interventions in China, with a focus on national disparities.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nMETHODS: National maternal and child mortality surveillance data were used to estimate child mortality. Coverage for proven interventions was analyzed based on data from the National Health Services Survey, National Nutrition and Health Survey, and National Immunization Survey. Consultations and qualitative field observations by experts were used to complement the Survey data.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nRESULTS: Analysis of the data revealed a significant reduction in the overall under-5 (U5) child mortality rate in China from 1996 to 2007, but also great regional disparities, with the risk of child mortality in rural areas II-IV being two- to sixfold higher than that in urban areas. Rural areas II-IV also accounted for approximately 80\% of the mortality burden. More than 60\% of child mortality occurred during the neonatal period, with 70\% of this occurring during the first week of life. The leading causes of neonatal mortality were asphyxia at birth and premature birth; during the post-neonatal period, these were diarrhea and pneumonia, especially in less developed rural areas. Utilization of health care services in terms of both quantity and quality was positively correlated with the region's development level. A large proportion of children were affected by inadequate feeding, and the lack of safe water and essential sanitary facilities are vital indirect factors contributing to the increase in child mortality. The simulation analysis revealed that increasing access to and the quality of the most effective interventions combined with relatively low costs in the context of a comprehensive approach has the potential to reduce U5 deaths by 34\%.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS: China is on track to meet MDG 4; however, great disparities in health care do exist within the country. It is therefore necessary to specifically target rural areas II-IV. Many causes of child mortality can be prevented or averted through the provision of basic health care. However, the leading predisposing factor contributing to child mortality in China is the insufficient coverage and poor quality of maternal and child health care services. Based on these data, we recommend that the government put more effort to ensure the health of the Chinese people, particularly in terms of providing the most vulnerable populations, i.e., children from the poorest areas and households, with access to good quality essential health care services.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trend data for causes of child death are crucial to inform priorities for improving child survival by and beyond 2015. We report child mortality by cause estimates in 2000-13, and cause-specific mortality scenarios to 2030 and 2035. METHODS: We estimated the distributions of causes of child mortality separately for neonates and children aged 1-59 months. To generate cause-specific mortality fractions, we included new vital registration and verbal autopsy data. We used vital registration data in countries with adequate registration systems. We applied vital registration-based multicause models for countries with low under-5 mortality but inadequate vital registration, and updated verbal autopsy-based multicause models for high mortality countries. We used updated numbers of child deaths to derive numbers of deaths by causes. We applied two scenarios to derive cause-specific mortality in 2030 and 2035. FINDINGS: Of the 6.3 million children who died before age 5 years in 2013, 51.8\% (3.257 million) died of infectious causes and 44\% (2.761 million) died in the neonatal period. The three leading causes are preterm birth complications (0.965 million [15.4\%, uncertainty range (UR) 9.8-24.5]; UR 0.615-1.537 million), pneumonia (0.935 million [14.9\%, 13.0-16.8]; 0.817-1.057 million), and intrapartum-related complications (0.662 million [10.5\%, 6.7-16.8]; 0.421-1.054 million). Reductions in pneumonia, diarrhoea, and measles collectively were responsible for half of the 3.6 million fewer deaths recorded in 2013 versus 2000. Causes with the slowest progress were congenital, preterm, neonatal sepsis, injury, and other causes. If present trends continue, 4.4 million children younger than 5 years will still die in 2030. Furthermore, sub-Saharan Africa will have 33\% of the births and 60\% of the deaths in 2030, compared with 25\% and 50\% in 2013, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Our projection results provide concrete examples of how the distribution of child causes of deaths could look in 15-20 years to inform priority setting in the post-2015 era. More evidence is needed about shifts in timing, causes, and places of under-5 deaths to inform child survival agendas by and beyond 2015, to end preventable child deaths in a generation, and to count and account for every newborn and every child.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nearly four-fifths of estimated 1.1 million smokers live in low or middle-income countries. We aimed to provide national estimates for Nepal on tobacco use prevalence, its distribution across demographic, socio-economic and spatial variables and correlates of tobacco use.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nMETHODS: A secondary data analysis of 2006 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) was done. A representative sample of 9,036 households was selected by two-stage stratified, probability proportional to size (PPS) technique. We constructed three outcome variables 'tobacco smoke', 'tobacco chewer' and 'any tobacco use' based on four questions about tobacco use that were asked in DHS questionnaires. Socio-economic, demographic and spatial predictor variables were used. We computed overall prevalence for 'tobacco smoking', 'tobacco chewing' and 'any tobacco use' i.e. point estimates of prevalence rates, 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) after adjustment for strata and clustering at primary sampling unit (PSU) level. For correlates of tobacco use, we used multivariate analysis to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and their 95\% CIs. A p-value {\textbackslash}textless 0.05 was considered as significant.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nRESULTS: Total number of households, eligible women and men interviewed was 8707, 10793 and 4397 respectively. The overall prevalence for 'any tobacco use', 'tobacco smoking' and 'tobacco chewing' were 30.3\% (95\% CI 28.9, 31.7), 20.7\% (95\% CI 19.5, 22.0) and 14.6\% (95\% CI 13.5, 15.7) respectively. Prevalence among men was significantly higher than women for 'any tobacco use' (56.5\% versus 19.6\%), 'tobacco smoking' (32.8\% versus 15.8\%) and 'tobacco chewing' (38.0\% versus 5.0\%). By multivariate analysis, older adults, men, lesser educated and those with lower wealth quintiles were more likely to be using all forms of tobacco. Divorced, separated, and widowed were more likely to smoke (OR 1.49, 95\% CI 1.14, 1.94) and chew tobacco (OR 1.36, 95\% CI 0.97, 1.93) as compared to those who were currently married. Prevalence of 'tobacco chewing' was higher in eastern region (19.7\%) and terai/plains (16.2\%). 'Tobacco smoking' and 'any tobacco use' were higher in rural areas, mid-western and far western and mountainous areas.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of tobacco use is considerably high among Nepalese people. Demographic and socioeconomic determinants and spatial distribution should be considered while planning tobacco control interventions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sub-national analyses of causes of death and time-trends help to define public health policy priorities. They are particularly important in countries undergoing epidemiological transition like Peru. There are no studies exploring Peruvian national and regional characteristics of such epidemiological transition. We aimed to describe Peru's national and regional mortality profiles between 1996 and 2000. METHODS: Registered mortality data for the study period were corrected for under-registration following standardized methods. Main causes of death by age group and by geographical region were determined. Departmental mortality profiles were constructed to evaluate mortality transition, using 1996 data as baseline. Annual cumulative slopes for the period 1996-2000 were estimated for each department and region. RESULTS: For the study period non-communicable diseases explained more than half of all causes of death, communicable diseases more than one third, and injuries 10.8\% of all deaths. Lima accounted for 32\% of total population and 20\% of total deaths. The Andean region, with 38\% of Peru's population, accounted for half of all country deaths. Departmental mortality predominance shifted from communicable diseases in 1996 towards non-communicable diseases and injuries in 2000. Maternal and perinatal conditions, and nutritional deficiencies and nutritional anaemia declined markedly in all departments and regions. Infectious diseases decreased in all regions except Lima. In all regions acute respiratory infections are a leading cause of death, but their proportion ranged from 9.3\% in Lima and Callao to 15.3\% in the Andean region. Tuberculosis and injuries ranked high in Lima and the Andean region. CONCLUSION: Peruvian mortality shows a double burden of communicable and non-communicable, with increasing importance of non-communicable diseases and injuries. This challenges national and sub-national health system performance and policy making.},

Methods: The data was collected in Tallinn (N = 1268 in Estonian and N = 901 in Russian schools), in Helsinki (N = 1396) and in Moscow (N = 618) from pupils aged 13-18 by self-administered questionnaire. Multilevel analysis was used to estimate the possible effects of background characteristics, of the proximity of other smokers and the school context on the tobacco use of pupils. Results: The prevalence rate of smoking among girls in Russian schools in Tallinn (34.6\%), among girls in Helsinki (39.5\%), and in Moscow (32.1\%) was higher than that among girls in Estonian schools in Tallinn (17.6\%). Smoking was slightly less prevalent among boys in Helsinki (27.5\%), compared to boys in Estonian (33.6\%) and Russian (35.6\%) schools in Tallinn, and to boys in Moscow (32.8\%). Smoking increased with age. Multilevel analysis showed that smoking differed by school among pupils. Individual determinants of smoking as study site, grade, friends', siblings' and parental smoking behaved differently depending upon school. Friends and siblings' smoking showed interaction with study site to the smoking among girls. Conclusions: Strategies aimed at influencing smoking behaviour need to be directed not only towards the individual, but also towards the influences within the child's school environment.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the U.K. Medical Research Council Myeloma IX trial (mmix), zoledronic acid 4 mg once every 3-4 weeks, compared with clodronate 1600 mg daily, reduced the incidence of skeletal related events (sres), increased progression-free survival (pfs), and prolonged overall survival (os) in 1970 patients with newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma. The incidence of confirmed osteonecrosis of the jaw was higher with zoledronic acid than with clodronate. The objective of the present study was to evaluate, based on the findings in mmix, the cost-effectiveness of zoledronic acid compared with clodronate in patients with newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma. METHODS: An economic model was used to project pfs, os, the incidence of sres and adverse events, and expected lifetime health care costs for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are alternatively assumed to receive zoledronic acid or clodronate. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (icer) of zoledronic acid compared with clodronate was calculated as the ratio of the difference in cost to the difference in quality-adjusted life years (qalys). Model inputs were based on results of mmix and published sources. Results were generated under different assumptions regarding the beneficial effects of zoledronic acid on os beyond 5 years after treatment initiation. RESULTS: Assuming lifetime treatment effects of zoledronic acid, treatment with zoledronic acid (compared with clodronate) increased qalys by 0.27 at an additional cost of CA\$13,407, yielding an icer of CA\$49,829 per qaly gained. If the threshold icer is CA\$100,000 per qaly, the estimated probability that zoledronic acid is cost-effective is 80\%. Assuming that the benefits of zoledronic acid on pfs and os diminish over 5 years beginning at the end of year 5, the icer is CAN\$63,027 per qaly gained. If the benefits of zoledronic acid on pfs and os are assumed to persist for 5 years only, the icer is CAN\$76,948 per qaly gained. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with clodronate, zoledronic acid represents a cost-effective treatment alternative in patients with multiple myeloma.},

	abstract = {This paper tests the significance of FDI as a way to alleviate credit constraints. Incoming foreign investment provides additional sources of capital. Specifically in the Chinese case, enterprises may look for foreign investors, being constrained in their activity due to distortions in the state-dominated system. First, the Chinese financial system allocates resources to the least efficient firms - state-owned enterprises - while denying the same resources to Chinese private enterprises, forcing them to look for a foreign investor. Second, the inefficient system of state investment planning leads to mismanagement of public enterprises, increasing `insolvency-induced FDI'. We propose to analyse determinants of FDI in Chinese provinces to test the above hypotheses. We control for traditional determinants of FDI such as market access, labour costs, productivity, infrastructure, reform advances and banking sector size in order to assess the impact of inter-provincial heterogeneity in terms of the access that private enterprises have to credit and the distortive management in state-owned firms.

	abstract = {Background: There is widespread concern that the present economic crisis, particularly its effect on unemployment, will adversely affect population health. We investigated how economic changes have affected mortality rates over the past three decades and identified how governments might reduce adverse effects. Methods: We used multivariate regression, correcting for population ageing, past mortality and employment trends, and country-specific differences in health-care infrastructure, to examine associations between changes in employment and mortality, and how associations were modified by different types of government expenditure for 26 European Union (EU) countries between 1970 and 2007. Findings: We noted that every 1\{\%\} increase in unemployment was associated with a 0??79\{\%\} rise in suicides at ages younger than 65 years (95\{\%\} CI 0??16-1??42; 60-550 potential excess deaths [mean 310] EU-wide), although the effect size was non-significant at all ages (0??49\{\%\}, -0??04 to 1??02), and with a 0??79\{\%\} rise in homicides (95\{\%\} CI 0??06-1??52; 3-80 potential excess deaths [mean 40] EU-wide). By contrast, road-traffic deaths decreased by 1??39\{\%\} (0??64-2??14; 290-980 potential fewer deaths [mean 630] EU-wide). A more than 3\{\%\} increase in unemployment had a greater effect on suicides at ages younger than 65 years (4??45\{\%\}, 95\{\%\} CI 0??65-8??24; 250-3220 potential excess deaths [mean 1740] EU-wide) and deaths from alcohol abuse (28??0\{\%\}, 12??30-43??70; 1550-5490 potential excess deaths [mean 3500] EU-wide). We noted no consistent evidence across the EU that all-cause mortality rates increased when unemployment rose, although populations varied substantially in how sensitive mortality was to economic crises, depending partly on differences in social protection. Every US\{\$\}10 per person increased investment in active labour market programmes reduced the effect of unemployment on suicides by 0??038\{\%\} (95\{\%\} CI -0??004 to -0??071). Interpretation: Rises in unemployment are associated with significant short-term increases in premature deaths from intentional violence, while reducing traffic fatalities. Active labour market programmes that keep and reintegrate workers in jobs could mitigate some adverse health effects of economic downturns.

Growth in FDI is positively correlated with the relative demand for skilled labor.

	abstract = {Since the adoption of the original version of ISIC in 1948, the majority of countries around the world have used ISIC as their national activity classification or have developed national classifications derived from ISIC. ISIC has therefore provided guidance to countries in developing national activity classifications and has become an important tool for comparing statistical data on economic activities at the international level. Wide use has been made of ISIC, both nationally and internationally, in classifying data according to kind of economic activity in the fields of economic and social statistics, such as for statistics on national accounts, demography of enterprises, employment and others. In addition, ISIC is increasingly used for non-statistical purposes. This fourth revision of ISIC (ISIC, Rev.4) is the outcome of a review process that spanned several years and involved contributions from many classifications experts and users around the world. This process resulted in an ISIC structure that is more detailed than the previous version, responding to the need to identify many new industries separately. This is especially applicable in the case of services. Moreover, the relevance of the Classification has been enhanced with the introduction of new high-level categories to better reflect current economic phenomena. A new section entitled “Information and communication” (see part three, sect. J) is one such innovation. Comparability has also been enhanced with a number of other regional activity classifications, thus making this version of ISIC a much improved tool for international data comparison. A number of alternate aggregations have been included in the present publication. They provide analytical tools for areas which, for conceptual reasons, do not lend themselves to aggregation within the existing ISIC structure. Among the alternate aggregations included in this version of ISIC are aggregations for information and communications technology, the informal sector and non-profit institutions, as well as two aggregations for national accounts-type analysis, one at very aggregated and another at an intermediate level of ISIC. The structure of the fourth revision of ISIC was considered and approved by the Statistical Commission at its thirty-seventh session, in March 2006,1 as the internationally accepted standard. It now replaces the third revision of the classification2 and its update, Revision 3.1,3 which have been in use since 1989 and 2002, respectively.},

The evidence on the subject has grown significantly since an earlier influential review was published in 2004. We find that in low-income countries or in countries with low human development index (HDI), the association between SES and obesity appears to be positive for both men and women: the more affluent and/or those with higher educational attainment tend to be more likely to be obese. However, in middle-income countries or in countries with medium HDI, the association becomes largely mixed for men and mainly negative for women. This particular shift appears to occur at an even lower level of per capita income than suggested by an influential earlier review. By contrast, obesity in children appears to be predominantly a problem of the rich in low- and middle-income countries.},

	abstract = {The econometric theory for panel data regressions was largely developed for survey data where N the number of individuals was large and T the number of time periods small. The asymptotic statistical theory was derived by letting N ! 1 for {\textbackslash}ldotsxed T. In recent years there has been growing interest in cases, such as sets of countries, regions or industries, where there are fairly long time-series for a large number of groups. These large T, large N, panel time-series raise a number of issues. First, since time-series tend to be non-stationary, determining the order of integration and cointegration becomes important. Second, since it is possible to estimate a separate regression for each group, it is natural to think of heterogeneous panels where parameters di¤er over groups. One can then test for parameter homogeneity rather than having to assume it as one is forced to do in small T panels. Third, one needs to determine the asymptotic properties of standard panel estimators when the data are non-stationary. Fourth, there is an issue of how to do the asymptotic analysis as both N and T can go to in{\textbackslash}ldotsnity. These issues have generated a large amount of recent econometric work and this paper provides an introductory survey for applied workers.},

	abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is an important and increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Accurate epidemiological studies are often logistically and financially difficult, but processes of rural-urban migration and epidemiological transition are certainly increasing the prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Type 1 disease is relatively rare, although this may be related to high mortality. This diabetic subgroup appears to present at a later age (by about a decade) than in Western countries. Variant forms of diabetes are also described in the continent; notably 'atypical, ketosis-prone' diabetes, and malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus. These types sometimes make the distinction between type 1 and type 2 diabetes difficult. Interestingly, this is also a current experience in the developed world. As more detailed and reliable complication studies emerge, it is increasingly apparent that African diabetes is associated with a high complication burden, which is both difficult to treat and prevent. More optimistically, a number of intervention studies and twinning projects are showing real benefits in varying locations. Future improvements depend on practical and sustainable support, coupled with local acceptance of diabetes as a major threat to the future health and quality of life of sub-Saharan Africans.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The theory of ecological unequal exchange explains how trade and various forms of economic activity create the problem of environmental degradation, and lead to the deterioration of population health. Based on this theory, our study examined the inter-relationship among economic characteristics, ecological footprints, CO2 emissions, infant mortality rates and under-5 mortality rates in low-income countries. DESIGN: A longitudinal ecological study design. SETTING: Sixty-six low-income countries from 1980 to 2010 were included in the analyses. Data for each country represented an average of 23 years (N=1497). DATA SOURCES: Data were from the World Development Indicators, UN Commodity Trade Statistics Database, Global Footprint Network and Polity IV Project. ANALYSES: Linear mixed models with a spatial power covariance structure and a correlation that decreased over time were constructed to accommodate the repeated measures. Statistical analyses were conducted separately by sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and other regions. RESULTS: After controlling for country-level sociodemographic characteristics, debt and manufacturing, economic activities were positively associated with infant mortality rates and under-5 mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa. By contrast, export intensity and foreign investment were beneficial for reducing infant and under-5 mortality rates in Latin America and other regions. Although the ecological footprints and CO2 emissions did not mediate the relationship between economic characteristics and health outcomes, export intensity increased CO2 emissions, but reduced the ecological footprints in sub-Saharan Africa. By contrast, in Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, although export intensity was positively associated with the ecological footprints and also CO2 emissions, the percentage of exports to high-income countries was negatively associated with the ecological footprints. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that environmental protection and economic development are important for reducing infant and under-5 mortality rates in low-income countries.},

Generally, empirical papers have failed to find an effect on industrial location of weaker or stricter environmental regulations. In this paper we find confirmation of theoretical predictions. We present a statistical test of the impact of environmental regulations on the capital movement of polluting industries. The empirical study is conducted by examining foreign direct investment (FDI) of several US industries, representing industries with high pollution control costs (chemicals and primary metals) as well as industries with more modest pollution control costs (electrical and non-electrical machinery, transportation equipment, and food products). At issue is the effect of the laxity of environmental regulation on FDI. As laxity is not directly observed, we posit two equations, one for FDI determination and one for pollutant emissions, a variable positively correlated with the unobserved variable. We use aggregate national sulfur emissions as the pollutant. Using instruments for the unobserved variable, the statistical results show that the laxity of environmental regulations in a host country is a significant determinant of FDI from the US for heavily polluting industries and is insignificant for less polluting industries.},

	abstract = {February 1997 The geographical distribution of foreign direct investment (FDI) within China is determined mostly by GNP, infrastructure development, level of general education, and coastal location. In the past, FDI has been biased toward speculative investment, especially the real estate sector; recently this bias has become less pronounced. Foreign direct investment (FDI) has played a major role in China's push toward a market-oriented economy. As part of the first phase of reforms that began in 1978, the Chinese government experimented with preferential policies to attract foreign capital. Between 1978 and 1995, China received \$128 billion in FDI. Recent inflows account for 40 percent of combined flows of FDI to all developing countries, making China the biggest developing country FDI recipient. This record is impressive, but certain problems must be overcome if FDI is to continue to help sustain the country's record growth rate and further its economic development. For one thing, FDI in China is highly concentrated geographically, and its sectoral distribution is highly uneven. Broadman and Sun empirically analyze the geographic determinants of FDI in China. They find that FDI's geographical distribution in China is determined mostly by GNP, infrastructure development, level of general education, and coastal location. Although the sectoral distribution of FDI is coming into line with the rest of the world - indeed, moving toward the pattern in more developed countries - in the past, FDI has been biased toward speculative types of investment, especially the real estate sector.

Methods: Thirty-one epidemiological studies were identified by a systematic search of four databases. Prevalence estimates were mapped and summarized by meta-analysis in each region of China. The pooled ORs and 95\% CIs of risk factors for diabetes were also calculated. Results: There was a large geographical imbalance with regard to the prevalence of diabetes. Region-pooled prevalence was highest in the eastern region (8.0\%, 95\% CI: 6.1-10.0\%) and lowest in the western region (4.6\%, 95\% CI: 3.3-6.0\%), which was consistent with regional levels of economic development. The overall prevalence of diabetes has been increasing since 1980. Traditional risk factors such as age, family history of diabetes, obesity, hypertension and elevated triglycerides were found to be associated with diabetes. In addition, urban residence and being from ethnic minorities were also significantly associated. Conclusion: Based on the meta-analyses, we found that the prevalence of diabetes is different in different parts of China but it has been increasing sharply during the last three decades. Some risk factors were quantitatively derived in the study, which are free from the diversity of a single sample. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Using a world-systems framework to examine cross-national variations in infant mortality, this paper seeks to emphasize the effects of global trade on national-level population health. Rather than viewing national-level health indicators as autonomous from broader global contexts, the study uses network analysis methods to examine the effects of international trade on infant mortality rates. Network data for countries were derived from international data on the trade of capital-intensive commodities in 2000. Using automorphic equivalence to measure the degree to which actors in a network perform similar roles, countries were assigned into one of six world-system blocks, each with its own pattern of trade. These blocks were dummy-coded and tested using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. A key finding from this analysis is that after controlling for national-level factors, the two blocks with the lowest density in capital-intensive exchange, i.e., the periphery, are significantly and positively associated with national-level infant mortality rates. Results show the effects of peripherality and stratification on population health, and highlight the influence of broader macro-level factors such as trade and globalization on national health. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	isbn = {0-8157-9862-8},
	abstract = {Images of sweatshop labor in developing countries have rallied opponents of globalization against foreign direct investment (FDI). The controversy is most acute over the treatment of low-skilled workers producing garments, footwear, toys, and sports equipment in foreign-owned plants or the plants of subcontractors. Activists cite low wages, poor working conditions, and a variety of economic, physical, and sexual abuses among the negative consequences of the globalization of industry. In Beyond Sweatshops, Theodore Moran examines the impact of FDI in manufacturing on growth and welfare in developing countries, and explores how host governments can take advantage of the contributions of foreign investment while avoiding the hazards to lower-skilled workers. He traces case studies of countries that have managed to produce steady improvement in worker treatment at plants exporting garments, footwear, and other labor-intensive products. The first part of the book examines multilateral proposals designed to place a floor under the treatment of workers around the world, contrasting a WTO-based system to enforce labor standards with "voluntary" arrangements, including corporate codes of conduct, certification organizations, and "sweatshop free" labeling. It explores the pros and cons of adding a "living wage" requirement to the ILO's core labor standards. The second part of the book presents data that significantly broadens our understanding of FDI. By analyzing the evidence from a variety of developing countries in Asia, Latin America, and Africa Moran demonstrates that most FDI goes to industrial sectors that employ trained workers who are not easily exploited. The flow of FDI to plants that produce electronics, auto parts, industrial equipment, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and medical equipment, paying production workers two to five times more than what is found in lower-skilled operations, is twenty-five times the flow to garment, textile, and footwear plants. Appropriately designed host country policies can transform the development trajectory of the entire economy. Moran advocates various "build-up" rather than "trickle down" strategies to enable developing countries to capture the benefits of FDI. He concludes by examining the impact of outward investment on workers and communities in the home economy, investigating evidence about what Ross Perot called the "great sucking sound," and asking whether the expansion of foreign investment in the developing world comes at the expense of good jobs and dynamic industries in the developed countries.},

	abstract = {The global integration of economies worldwide has led to increased pressure for "labor flexibility". A notable aspect of this trend has been the rise in non-standard work arrangements, which include part-time work, temporary agency-based work, fixed-term contingent work, and independent contracting. Although non-standard work arrangements are convenient for employers, they are often associated with poor pay, absence of pension and health benefits, as well as lack of protection from unions and labor laws. Studies have begun to address the question of whether these "precarious" jobs pose a health hazard for workers. The challenge for causal inference is that precarious workers are likely to differ from non-precarious workers in a variety of characteristics that also influence health outcomes, i.e. there is confounding and selection bias. However, even after taking account of these biases-through propensity score-matched analysis-there is evidence to suggest that non-standard work may be damaging to workers' health. Policies modeled after the European Union's Directive on Part-Time Work may help to mitigate some of the health hazards associated with precarious work.},

Our explanations fall into three re-categories: (1) work and economic conditions, (2) social-psychological sources, and (3) health lifestyle. We replicate analyses with two samples, cross-sectionally and over time, using two health measures (self-reported health and physical functioning). The first data set comes from a national probability sample of U.S. households in which respondents were interviewed by telephone in 1990 (2,031 respondents, ages 18 to 90). The second data set comes from a national probability sample of U.S. households in which re-spondents ages 20 to 64 were interviewed by telephone first in 1979 (3,025 respondents), and then again in 1980 (2,436 respondents). Results demon-strate a positive association between education and health and help explain why the association exists. (1) Compared to the poorly educated, well edu-cated respondents are less likely to be unemployed, are more likely to work full-time, to have fulfilling, subjectively rewarding jobs, high incomes, and low economic hardship. Full-time work, fulfilling work, high income, and low economic hardship in turn significantly improve health in all analyses. (2) The well educated report a greater sense of control over their lives and their health, and they have higher levels of social support. The sense of control, and to a lesser extent support, are associated with good health. (3) The well educated are less likely to smoke, are more likely to exercise, to get health check-ups, and to drink moderately, all of which, except check-ups, are asso-ciated with good health. We conclude that high educational attainment im-proves health directly, and it improves health indirectly through work and economic conditions, social-psychological resources, and health lifestyle.},

Expanding on this point, we describe four disequalising dynamics by which contemporary globalisation causes divergence: the global reorganisation of production and emergence of a global labour-market; the increasing importance of binding trade agreements and processes to resolve disputes; the rapidly increasing mobility of financial capital; and the persistence of debt crises in developing countries. Generic policies designed to reduce health inequities are described with reference to the three Rs of redistribution, regulation, and rights.

Time trend of the overall death rates over the period 2000-2012 was examined using Poisson regression models. Pattern of AIDS deaths was examined for the period 2006-2012, using the age-, gender-, and region-specific death rates. The results indicated that HIV/AIDS-related death rate increased significantly in China over the past decade, with an average annual percentage change of 22.3\%. A vast majority of the deaths occurred among those aged between 20 and 65 years, with two age peaks. The death rate was higher for males than females and in rural areas than urban areas. A total of 83\% of the deaths occurred among rural residents and 67\% among males. The upward trend and distribution pattern of HIV/AIDS-related deaths depicted in the present study not only provides valuable information for additional understanding of the dynamics of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in China, but also has implications for evidence-based public health intervention strategies and policies as well as for further studies.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic status (SES) is usually measured by determining education, income, occupation, or a composite of these dimensions. Although education is the most commonly used measure of SES in epidemiological studies, no investigators in the United States have conducted an empirical analysis quantifying the relative impact of each separate dimension of SES on risk factors for disease. METHODS: Using data on 2380 participants from the Stanford Five-City Project (85\{\%\} White, non-Hispanic), we examined the independent contribution of education, income, and occupation to a set of cardiovascular disease risk factors (cigarette smoking, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). RESULTS: The relationship between these SES measures and risk factors was strongest and most consistent for education, showing higher risk associated with lower levels of education. Using a forward selection model that allowed for inclusion of all three SES measures after adjustment for age and time of survey, education was the only measure that was significantly associated with the risk factors (P less than .05). CONCLUSION: If economics or time dictate that a single parameter of SES be chosen and if the research hypothesis does not dictate otherwise, higher education may be the best SES predictor of good health.},

Some recent location choice studies have found evidence of this attraction, but only for inward FDI in industrial countries. The few studies of inward FDI in developing countries have been hampered by weak measures of environmental stringency and by insufficient data to estimate variation in firm response by pollution intensity. This paper tests for pollution haven behavior by estimating the determinants of location choice for equity joint ventures (EJVs) in China. Beginning with a theoretical framework of firm production and abatement decisions, we derive and estimate a location choice model using data on a sample of EJV projects, Chinese effective levies on water pollution, and Chinese industrial pollution intensity. Results show EJVs in highly-polluting industries funded through Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan are attracted by weak environmental standards. In contrast, EJVs funded from non-ethnically Chinese sources are not significantly attracted by weak standards, regardless of the pollution intensity of the industry. These findings are consistent with pollution haven behavior, but not by investors from high income countries and only in industries that are highly polluting. Further investigation into differences in technology between industrial and developing country investors might shed new light on this debate.},

Among the visible manifestations of globalization are the greater international movement of goods and services, financial capital, information and people. In addition, there are technological developments, more transboundary cultural exchanges, facilitated by the freer trade of more differentiated products as well as by tourism and immigration, changes in the political landscape and ecological consequences. In this paper, we link the Maastricht Globalization Index with health indicators to analyse if more globalized countries are doing better in terms of infant mortality rate, under-five mortality rate, and adult mortality rate. The results indicate a positive association between a high level of globalization and low mortality rates. In view of the arguments that globalization provides winners and losers, and might be seen as a disequalizing process, we should perhaps be careful in interpreting the observed positive association as simple evidence that globalization is mostly good for our health. It is our hope that a further analysis of health impacts of globalization may help in adjusting and optimising the process of globalization on every level in the direction of a sustainable and healthy development for all.},

This review of available literature on tobacco industry privatisation suggests that any economic benefits of privatisation may be lower than supposed, because private owners avoid competitive tenders (thus underpaying for assets), negotiate lengthy tax holidays and are complicit in the smuggling of cigarettes to avoid import and excise duties. It outlines how privatisation leads to increased marketing, more effective distribution and lower prices, creating additional demand for cigarettes among new and existing smokers, leading to increased cigarette consumption, higher smoking prevalence and lower age of smoking initiation. Privatisation also weakens tobacco control because private owners, in their drive for profits, lobby aggressively against effective policies and ignore or overturn existing policies. This evidence suggests that further tobacco industry privatisation is likely to increase smoking and that instead of transferring assets from state to private ownership, alternative models of supply should be explored.},

Too much fiscal decentralization hurts central government incentives, whereas too little fiscal decentralization renders the local governments vulnerable to capture by the protectionist special interest groups. Moreover, the local government's preference for FDI can be endogenously polarized; therefore, a small change in fiscal decentralization across certain threshold values may lead to a dramatic difference in equilibrium FDI inflows. Empirical investigations support the idea that the difference in fiscal decentralization is an important reason for the nine-fold difference in FDI per capita between China and India. Cross-country regression results also support the inverted-U relationship. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper provides statistical methods that permit the association of socioeconomic status and health to be partially unraveled in panel data by excluding some postulated causal paths, or delimiting their range of action. These methods are applied to the Asset and Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old (AHEAD) Panel to test for the absence of causal links from socioeconomic status (SES) to health innovations and mortality, and from health conditions to innovations in wealth. We conclude that in this elderly American population, where Medicare covers most acute care and pension income is not affected by ability to work, the evidence supports the hypothesis of no direct causal link from SES to mortality and to incidence of most sudden onset health conditions (accidents and some acute conditions), once initial health conditions are controlled, but there is some association of SES with incidence of gradual onset health conditions (mental conditions, and some degenerative and chronic conditions), due either to causal links or to persistent unobserved behavioral or genetic factors that have a common influence on both SES and innovations in health. There is mixed evidence for an association of health conditions and innovations in wealth. The death of a spouse appears to have a negative effect on the wealth of the survivor; this is plausibly a direct causal effect. There is evidence for some association of health conditions with increased dissaving from liquid wealth for intact couples and singles. From these findings, we conclude that there is no evidence that SES-linked therapies for acute diseases induce mortality differentials. The question of whether SES-linked preventative care influences onset of chronic and mental diseases remains open.

	abstract = {The science of research synthesis is rapidly evolving; hence the methods employed in the conduct of Cochrane reviews have developed over time. The aim of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (the Handbook) is to help Cochrane review authors make appropriate decisions about the methods they use, rather than to dictate arbitrary standards. Wherever possible, recommendations are informed by empirical evidence. The guidance provided here is intended to help reviewauthors to be systematic, informed and explicit (but not mechanistic) about the questions they pose and how they derive answers to those questions. Interpretation and implementation of this guidance requires judgement and should be done in conjunction with editorial bases of CRGs. This Handbook focuses on systematic reviews of the effects of interventions. Most of the advice contained within it is oriented to the synthesis of clinical trials, and of randomized trials in particular because they provide more reliable evidence than other study designs on the relative effects of healthcare interventions (Kunz 2007). Some chapters, however, provide advice on including other types of evidence, particularly in forms of care where randomized trials may not be possible or appropriate and in con- siderations of safety or adverse effects. In 2003, The Cochrane Collaboration expanded its scope to include Cochrane Diagnostic test accuracy reviews. Guidance for the con- duct of these reviews is contained in a separate document: the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy. ThisHandbookhas 22 chapters organized into three parts.Part 1 introduces Cochrane reviews, covering their planning and preparation, and their maintenance and updat- ing, and ends with a guide to the contents of a Cochrane review or protocol. Part 2 provides general methodological guidance relevant to all Cochrane reviews, cover- ing question development, eligibility criteria, searching, collecting data, within-study bias, analysing data, reporting bias, presenting and interpreting results. Part 3 addresses special topics that will be relevant to some, but not all, Cochrane reviews, including par- ticular considerations in addressing adverse effects, meta-analysis with non-standard study designs and using individual patient data. This part has chapters on incorpo- rating economic evaluations, non-randomized studies, qualitative research, patient- reported outcomes in reviews, prospective meta-analysis and reviews in health promo- tion and public health. A final chapter describes the new review type, Overviews of reviews. Each chapter contains a list of key points to summarize the information and draw out the main messages for review authors. The Handbook is largely prepared by The Cochrane Collaborations Methods Groups, whose members conduct much of the methodological and empirical research that informs the guidance. Although the main intended audience for the Handbook is authors of Cochrane Intervention reviews, many of the principles and methods are applicable to systematic reviews applied to other types of research and to systematic reviews of interventions undertaken by others (Moher 2007).},

	doi = {10.1136/bmj.328.7443.801},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the demographic, socioeconomic, and geographical distribution of tobacco consumption in India. DESIGN: Multilevel cross sectional analysis of the 1998-9 Indian national family health survey of 301 984 individuals in 92 447 households in 3215 villages in 440 districts in 26 states. SETTING: Indian states. PARTICIPANTS: 301 984 adults ({\textbackslash}textgreater or = 18 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dichotomous variable for smoking and chewing tobacco for each respondent (1 if yes, 0 if no) as well as a combined measure of whether an individual smokes, chews tobacco, or both. RESULTS: Smoking and chewing tobacco are systematically associated with socioeconomic markers at the individual and household level. Individuals with no education are 2.69 times more likely to smoke and chew tobacco than those with postgraduate education. Households belonging to the lowest fifth of a standard of living index were 2.54 times more likely to consume tobacco than those in the highest fifth. Scheduled tribes (odds ratio 1.23, 95\% confidence interval 1.18 to 1.29) and scheduled castes (1.19, 1.16 to 1.23) were more likely to consume tobacco than other caste groups. The socioeconomic differences are more marked for smoking than for chewing tobacco. Socioeconomic markers and demographic characteristics of individuals and households do not account fully for the differences at the level of state, district, and village in smoking and chewing tobacco, with state accounting for the bulk of the variation in tobacco consumption. CONCLUSION: The distribution of tobacco consumption is likely to maintain, and perhaps increase, the current considerable socioeconomic differentials in health in India. Interventions aimed at influencing change in tobacco consumption should consider the socioeconomic and geographical determinants of people's susceptibility to consume tobacco.},

All those aspects of nutritional behavior are important inputs to the production of health. A dynamic panel data model is used to estimate demand functions for fat, protein, alcohol, cigarettes and diversity of the diet. The results suggest the existence of strong habits in drinking and smoking, and the absence of habits in fat and protein consumption. We also found evidence of habit formation for food diversity. Comparing nutritional behavior of younger and older consumers, we find significant differences in the demand for fat and cigarettes. Older consumers seem to be more persistent in their drinking and smoking behavior. Similarly, men show higher habit persistence for alcohol and cigarette consumption. The results also suggest that among individual determinants, especially education, income and employment have statistically significant impacts on consumption behavior. Regarding the macroeconomic variables, economic growth is negatively related to protein consumption, while regional unemployment rate is negatively affecting the demand for protein and food diversity. Finally, Russian consumers react to the price changes of alcohol, cigarettes, fat and protein as suggested by theory. Consumer demand for food diversity responds negatively to price changes of alcohol and cigarettes, but positively to the price of fat. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

It has been argued that developing countries might enhance their attractiveness as locations for FDI by pursuing policies that raise the level of local skills and build up human resource capabilities. Nevertheless, the empirical evidence in the literature in support of this recommendation for a large sample of developing countries is scant. This paper evaluates this argument in the light of the evolution in the structural characteristics of FDI and empirically tests the hypothesis that the level of human capital in host countries may affect the geographical distribution of FDI. The empirical findings are: (a) human capital is a statistically significant determinant of FDI inflows; (b) human capital is one of the most important determinants; and (c) its importance has become increasingly greater through time},

The backward and forward linkage effects of FDI are negative with significant regional disparity. The geographic distribution of FDI also influences spillovers, with an increase in FDI inflow to the top FDI recipient provinces increasing the forward linkage spillovers.

The evidence reviewed makes a strong argument that global trade is likely to have a significant impact on mental health. However, the mental health outcomes of global trade will be influenced by a host of contextual factors and will therefore be heterogeneous. Preliminary recommendations for discussion are considered.},

	abstract = {Introduction to Modern Economic Growthis a groundbreaking text from one of today's leading economists. Daron Acemoglu gives graduate students not only the tools to analyze growth and related macroeconomic problems, but also the broad perspective needed to apply those tools to the big-picture questions of growth and divergence. And he introduces the economic and mathematical foundations of modern growth theory and macroeconomics in a rigorous but easy to follow manner.After covering the necessary background on dynamic general equilibrium and dynamic optimization, the book presents the basic workhorse models of growth and takes students to the frontier areas of growth theory, including models of human capital, endogenous technological change, technology transfer, international trade, economic development, and political economy. The book integrates these theories with data and shows how theoretical approaches can lead to better perspectives on the fundamental causes of economic growth and the wealth of nations.Innovative and authoritative, this book is likely to shape how economic growth is taught and learned for years to come.Introduces all the foundations for understanding economic growth and dynamic macroeconomic analysisFocuses on the big-picture questions of economic growthProvides mathematical foundationsPresents dynamic general equilibriumCovers models such as basic Solow, neoclassical growth, and overlapping generations, as well as models of endogenous technology and international linkagesAddresses frontier research areas such as international linkages, international trade, political economy, and economic development and structural changeAn accompanying Student Solutions Manual containing the answers to selected exercises will be available Spring 2009 (978-0-691-14163-3/\$24.95).

In long-run equilibrium, CO2 emissions appear to be energy consumption elastic and FDI inelastic, and the results seem to support the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. The causality results indicate that there exists strong bidirectional causality between emissions and FDI and unidirectional strong causality running from output to FDI. The evidence seems to support the pollution haven and both the halo and scale effects. Therefore, in attracting FDI, developing countries should strictly examine the qualifications for foreign investment or to promote environmental protection through the coordinated know-how and technological transfer with foreign companies to avoid environmental damage. Additionally, there exists strong output-emissions and output-energy consumption bidirectional causality, while there is unidirectional strong causality running from energy consumption to emissions. Overall, the method of managing both energy demand and FDI and increasing both investment in the energy supply and energy efficiency to reduce CO2 emissions and without compromising the country's competitiveness can be adopted by energy-dependent BRIC countries. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

We explain our rationale for defining globalization with reference to the emergence of a global marketplace, and the economic and political choices that have facilitated that emergence. We identify a number of conceptual milestones in studying the relation between globalization and SDH over the period 1987-2005, and then show that because globalization comprises multiple, interacting policy dynamics, reliance on evidence from multiple disciplines (transdisciplinarity) and research methodologies is required. So, too, is explicit recognition of the uncertainties associated with linking globalization - the quintessential "upstream" variable - with changes in SDH and in health outcomes.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional samples-collected nine times between 1992 and 2000-from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey provide interviewer-administered 24-h diet recalls and measured height and weight, together with detailed information regarding income and expenditures. SETTING: The Russian Federation. SUBJECTS: Women and men, aged 19-55 y. INTERVENTIONS: None. METHODS: A nationally representative sample of working-age Russian adults was stratified by gender and income (per cent of regional poverty level). Secular trends in mean energy and macronutrient intake, as well as prevalence of overweight and obesity in the population are described over the first 8 y of the Russian Federation. RESULTS: Overall, energy intake increased slightly. Fat, as a percentage of energy (E\%), decreased from 39.6 to 31.6\% and protein, as a per cent of energy, decreased from 14.3 to 12.5\%. Overweight (determined by body mass index (BMI) {\textbackslash}textgreater/=25 kg/m(2)) prevalence remained relatively stable at about 50\% and obesity (BMI {\textbackslash}textgreater/=30 kg/m(2)) prevalence increased from 13.3 to 16.0\% of the adult population. Women consumed less energy than men and displayed higher prevalences of overweight and obesity in all time periods. There was an income effect among men in all time periods, with higher-income men consuming more calories, fat, and protein than lower-income men; this effect was not apparent in women except in the proportion of fat and protein intake. CONCLUSIONS: The adult Russian population appears to have escaped macronutrient privation during economic reform and has experienced increasing rates of obesity.},

Design/methodology/approach: The authors use panel data from 27 OECD and non-OECD high income countries for the period 1980 to 2003. Instrumental variable estimation of a dynamic panel model within a system generalised methods of moments framework allows us to control for both potential correlation issues and endogeneity bias. Findings: This paper finds that a currency union is the policy framework most conducive to cross-border investment. Being a member of EMU also appears to spur greater FDI flows with countries floating their currency vis-\{à\}-vis the default regime of a double-float. Country-pair regime combinations involving one country fixing its currency and the other floating or being a member of EMU, are found not to be more pro-FDI than the default regime combination. For country-pairs fixing or pegging their currency to each other, the effect on bilateral FDI flows is the least consistent across alternative specifications and, hence, the most ambiguous. Originality/value: The contribution is also distinguished by the comparative use of recently developed "natural" or de facto exchange rate regime classification schemes, in addition to the de jure classification published by the IMF. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {In a "nutrition transition", the consumption of foods high in fats and sweeteners is increasing throughout the developing world. The transition, implicated in the rapid rise of obesity and diet-related chronic diseases worldwide, is rooted in the processes of globalization. Globalization affects the nature of agri-food systems, thereby altering the quantity, type, cost and desirability of foods available for consumption. Understanding the links between globalization and the nutrition transition is therefore necessary to help policy makers develop policies, including food policies, for addressing the global burden of chronic disease. While the subject has been much discussed, tracing the specific pathways between globalization and dietary change remains a challenge. To help address this challenge, this paper explores how one of the central mechanisms of globalization, the integration of the global marketplace, is affecting the specific diet patterns. Focusing on middle-income countries, it highlights the importance of three major processes of market integration: (I) production and trade of agricultural goods; (II) foreign direct investment in food processing and retailing; and (III) global food advertising and promotion. The paper reveals how specific policies implemented to advance the globalization agenda account in part for some recent trends in the global diet. Agricultural production and trade policies have enabled more vegetable oil consumption; policies on foreign direct investment have facilitated higher consumption of highly-processed foods, as has global food marketing. These dietary outcomes also reflect the socioeconomic and cultural context in which these policies are operating. An important finding is that the dynamic, competitive forces unleashed as a result of global market integration facilitates not only convergence in consumption habits (as is commonly assumed in the "Coca-Colonization" hypothesis), but adaptation to products targeted at different niche markets. This convergence-divergence duality raises the policy concern that globalization will exacerbate uneven dietary development between rich and poor. As high-income groups in developing countries accrue the benefits of a more dynamic marketplace, lower-income groups may well experience convergence towards poor quality obseogenic diets, as observed in western countries. Global economic policies concerning agriculture, trade, investment and marketing affect what the world eats. They are therefore also global food and health policies. Health policy makers should pay greater attention to these policies in order to address some of the structural causes of obesity and diet-related chronic diseases worldwide, especially among the groups of low socioeconomic status.},

More specifically, the results indicate that in the classes where teachers describe their approach to teaching as having a focus on what they do and on transmitting knowledge, students are more likely to report that they adopt a surface approach to the learning of that subject. Conversely, but less strongly, in the classes where students report adopting significantly deeper approaches to learning, teaching staff report adopting approaches to teaching that are more oriented towards students and to changing the students conceptions. The study made use of a teaching approach inventory derived from interviews with academic staff, and a modified approach to learning questionnaire. These conclusions are derived from a factor and cluster analysis of 48 classes (involving 46 science teachers and 3956 science students) in Australian universities. The results complete a chain of relations from teacher thinking to the outcomes of student learning. Previous studies have shown relations between teachers' conceptions of teaching and learning and their approaches to teaching. Numerous studies have shown correlations between students' deeper approaches to learning and higher quality learning outcomes. The results reported here link these two sets of studies. They also highlight the importance, in attempts to improve the quality of student learning, of discouraging teacher-focused transmission teaching and encouraging higher quality, conceptual change/student-focused approaches to teaching.},

	abstract = {Regional economic growth in Russia's regions in 1995- 2000 is analysed with particular attention paid to FDI and how it influenced growth during this period. FDI appears to have been essential before the 1998 crisis in helping the economy grow despite the initial chaos of the transition. Larger regional economies that have garnered most FDI and perhaps gone further with institutional reforms that can assist in capturing the full benefits of FDI are likely to lead economic growth in the future. All regions need to take advantage now of the favourable economic environment to assess and learn from prior FDI experience to foster future growth should the price of oil and the remaining advantage of a depreciated currency change. No evidence was found that region wide corruption hindered economic growth in the 1990s. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Russia has been quite low relative to other transition countries despite the clear evidence from both a theoretical (Moosa, 2002) and practical point of view that Russia needs a lot of FDI (Fabry \& Zeghni, 2002; EBRD, 2001). Why Russia has not received more FDI is well discussed in the literature using firm level data (e.g. Yudaeva et al., 2003; Manaenkov, 2000) as well as macroeconomic indicators (e.g. Bevan \& Estrin, 2000). FDI is especially topical given the recent surge prior to the Yukos scandal that led to more FDI in Russia in the first ten months of 2003 than in the entire prior decade (White et al., 2003) plus the glowing macroeconomic performance in recent years (Chazan, 2004). Using the existing literature on regional growth in Russia over the past decade (1994- 2004) and relatively new regional panel data, a growth equation explains important dynamic growth differences that might be influenced by regional FDI (e.g. Popov, 2001) beyond single projects such as the oil project in Sakhalin region (Dresen, 2004). Various sensitivity regressions are done to examine how regional growth might have differed in short periods and with a smaller sample. As outlined by Zhang (2001) in a study of Chinese regions, economic growth can be modeled by a standard production function with labour and capital inputs. However, the residual 'A' term is endogenously determined by both the flow of FDI and the share of FDI stock relative to GRP (gross regional product). The flow of FDI measures the externalities and technology diffusion of foreign firms in a region.},

Methods: A systematic search was conducted for studies published between 2000 and 2010. Studies reporting DM prevalence were included if they met the pre-determined criteria. The prevalence estimates and reported determinants of these studies were compared. Results: Twenty-five manuscripts, reporting on 22 studies, were selected for inclusion in the review. There has been an increase in DM prevalence from 2.6\% to 9.7\% in China over the past decade. DM prevalence is strongly associated with age and is higher in urban residents compared with rural populations. Some studies found a difference in DM prevalence between males and females, but this finding was not consistent. Other commonly reported associations with DM included family history, obesity and hypertension. Conclusion: Over the period of 2000-2010, we identify a significant increase in DM prevalence at the national level. It is important for all levels of government to develop more effective strategies to prevent and manage this rising diabetes epidemic.

	abstract = {The remarkable increase in FDI flows to developing countries over the last decade has focused attention on whether this source of financing enhances overall economic growth. We use a mixed fixed and random (MFR) panel data estimation method to allow for cross country heterogeneity in the causal relationship between FDI and growth and contrast our findings with those from traditional approaches. We find that the relationship between investment, both foreign and domestic, and economic growth in developing countries is highly heterogeneous and that estimation methods which assume homogeneity across countries can yield misleading results. Our results suggest there is some evidence that the efficacy of FDI in raising future growth rates, although heterogeneous across countries, is higher in more open economies.},

Applying the instrumental variable threshold regressions approach to cross-sectional data for 85 countries, it finds that social capability such as human capital, financial development, and political institutions defines the impacts of trade and FDI on domestic investment. Particularly, trade adversely affects investment in low-human-capital, less-financially-developed, or more-corrupted countries, but positively affects it in countries with opposite attributes. In contrast, FDI has a positive effect on investment in countries with low human capital, less-developed financial sectors, or high corruption, but a negative impact in countries with opposite attributes. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

In the context of such a high burden of tobacco use, this study examines the regional variations, and socioeconomic, demographic and other correlates of smoking, smokeless tobacco and dual use of tobacco in India.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed a cross sectional, nationally representative sample of individuals from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey in India (2009-10), which covered 69,296 individuals aged 15 years and above. The current tobacco use in three forms, namely, smoking only, smokeless tobacco use only, and both smoking and smokeless tobacco use were considered as outcomes in this study. Descriptive statistics, cross tabulations and multinomial logistic regression analysis were adopted as analytical tools. Smokeless tobacco use was the major form of tobacco use in India followed by smoking and dual tobacco use. Tobacco use was higher among males, the less educated, the poor, and the rural population in India. Respondents lacking knowledge of health hazards of tobacco had higher prevalence of tobacco use in each form. The prevalence of different forms of tobacco use varies significantly by states. The prevalence of tobacco use increases concomitantly with age among females. Middle-aged adult males had higher prevalence of tobacco use. Age, education and region were found to be significant determinants of all forms of tobacco use. Adults from the poor household had significantly higher risk of consuming smokeless tobacco. Lack of awareness about the selected hazards of tobacco significantly affects tobacco use.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need to curb the use of tobacco among the sub-groups of population with higher prevalence. Tobacco control policies in India should adopt a targeted, population-based approach to control and reduce tobacco consumption in the country.},

Health risks associated with exclusive use of one form of tobacco alone has a different health risk profile when compared to dual use. In order to tease out specific profiles of mutually exclusive categories of tobacco use, we carried out this analysis.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nMETHODS: The Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) data was used to describe the profiles of three mutually exclusive tobacco use categories ("Current smoking only," "Current smokeless tobacco [SLT] use only," and "Dual use") in four World Health Organization South-East Asia Region countries, namely Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and Thailand. GATS was a nationally representative household-based survey that used a stratified multistage cluster sampling design proportional to population size. Prevalence of different forms of usage were described as proportions. Logistics regression analyses was performed to calculate odds ratios (OR) with 95\% confidence intervals. All analyses were weighted, accounted for the complex sampling design and conducted using SPSS version 18.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nRESULTS: The prevalence of different forms of tobacco use varied across countries. Current tobacco use ranged from 27.2\% in Thailand to 43.3\% in Bangladesh. Exclusively smoking was more common in Indonesia (34.0\%) and Thailand (23.4\%) and less common in Bangladesh (16.1\%) and India (8.7\%). Exclusively using SLT was more common in Bangladesh (20.3\%) and India (20.6\%) and less common on Indonesia (0.9\%) and Thailand (3.5\%). Dual use of smoking and SLT was found in Bangladesh (6.8\%) and India (5.3\%), but was negligible in Indonesia (0.8) and Thailand (0.4\%). Gender, age, education and wealth had significant effects on the OR for most forms of tobacco use across all four countries with the exceptions of SLT use in Indonesia and dual use in both Indonesia and Thailand. In general, the different forms of tobacco use increased among males and with increasing age; and decreased with higher education and wealth. The results for urban versus rural residence were mixed and frequently not significant once controlling for the other demographic factors.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nCONCLUSION: This study addressed the socioeconomic disparities, which underlie health inequities due to tobacco use. Tobacco control activities in these countries should take in account local cultural, social and demographic factors for successful implementation.},

A lack of evidence on data falsification does not mean that China's statistical system is necessarily honest in its statistical reporting, but recent developments in China's statistical system further suggest that data falsification at the higher levels of the statistical bureaucracy is unlikely. Nevertheless, even if data are not being purposefully falsified by the National Bureau of Statistics, the margin of error in much of the published data is likely to be sufficiently large to allow the statistical authority a choice of final value from a relatively wide range of equally correct values.},

We argue that better developed financial systems allow an economy to exploit the benefits of foreign direct investment more efficiently. The estimation draws upon an unrestricted error-correction model to avoid omitted lagged variable bias, and an instrumental variable estimator to correct for endogeneity bias. Using annual time series data from 1970 to 2004, the results show that financial development stimulates economic development whereas foreign direct investment impacts negatively on output expansion in the long run. However, an increased level of financial development enables Thailand to gain more from foreign direct investment, suggesting that the impact of foreign direct investment on output growth can be enhanced through financial development.

	abstract = {Foreign direct investment (FDI) has grown dramatically and is now the largest and most stable source of private capital for developing countries and economies in transition, accounting for nearly 50 percent of all those flows. Meanwhile, the growing role of FDI in host countries has been accompanied by a change of attitude, from critical wariness toward multinational corporations to sometimes uncritical enthusiasm about involving foreign firms in the development process.What are the most valuable benefits and opportunities that foreign firms have to offer? What risks and dangers do they pose? And beyond improving the micro and macroeconomic "fundamentals" in their own countries and building an investment-friendly environment, do authorities in host countries need a proactive and interventionist (rather than passive) policy toward foreign investment?In one of the most comprehensive studies on FDI in two decades, Theodore Moran synthesizes evidence drawn from a wealth of case literature to assess policies toward FDI in these countries, with a focus on investment promotion, domestic and content mandates, export-performance requirements, joint-venture requirements, and technology-licensing mandates. The study demonstrates that there is indeed a large, energetic, and vital role for host authorities to play in designing policies toward FDI, but that the actions needed differ substantially from conventional beliefs on the topic. Moran offers a new and controversial agenda for host governments, aimed at maximizing the benefits they can obtain from FDI while minimizing the dangers, and suggests how they might best pursue this agenda.

However, the higher productivity of FDI holds only when the host country has a minimum threshold stock of human capital. Thus, FDI contributes to economic growth only when a sufficient absorptive capability of the advanced technologies is available in the host economy.},

	abstract = {RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Self-report and biomedical data were collected from98,058 adults aged \&Dagger;18 years (90.5\% response) from 162 areas spanning mainland China. Diabetes status was assessed using American Diabetes Association criteria. Among those with diabetes, detection was defined by prior diagnosis. Choropleth maps were used to visually assess geographical variation in each outcome at the provincial level. The odds of each outcome were assessed usingmultilevel logistic regression, with adjustment for person- and area-level characteristics. RESULTS: Geographic visualization at the provincial level indicated widespread variation in diabetes prevalence and detection across China. Regional prevalence adjusted for age, sex, and urban/rural socioeconomic circumstances (SECs) ranged from 8.3\% (95\% CI 7.2\%, 9.7\%) in the northeast to 12.7\% (11.1\%, 14.6\%) in the north. A clear negative gradient in diabetes prevalence was observed from13.1\%(12.0\%, 14.4\%) in the urban high-SEC to 8.7\% (7.8\%, 9.6\%) in rural low-SEC counties/districts. Adjusting for health literacy and other person-level characteristics only partially attenuated these geographic variations. Only one-third of participants living with diabetes had been previously diagnosed, but this also varied substantively by geography. Regional detection adjusted for age, sex, and urban/rural SEC, for example, spanned from 40.4\% (34.9\%, 46.3\%) in the north to 15.6\% (11.7\%, 20.5\%) in the southwest. Compared with detection of 40.8\% (37.3\%, 44.4\%) in urban high-SEC counties, detection was poorest among rural low-SEC counties at just 20.5\% (17.7\%, 23.7\%). Person-level characteristics did not fully account for these geographic variations in diabetes detection.

Instead, the increased difficulty of imitation generates resource wasting and imitation disincentive effects that reduce both FDI and innovation. The greater resources absorbed in imitation crowd out FDI.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To investigate the socio-economic and demographic determinants of tobacco use in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. METHODS: Cross sectional survey of households (population based) with 2018 respondent (1038 Rural; 980 Urban) was carried out in Rawalpindi (Pakistan) and included males and females 18-65 years of age. Main outcome measure was self reported daily tobacco use. RESULTS: Overall 16.5\% of the study population (33\% men and 4.7\% women) used tobacco on a daily basis. Modes of tobacco use included cigarette smoking (68.5\%), oral tobacco (13.5\%), hukka (12\%) and cigarette smoking plus oral tobacco (6\%). Among those not using tobacco products, 56\% were exposed to Environmental tobacco smoke. The adjusted odds ratio of tobacco use for rural residence compared to urban residence was 1.49 (95\% CI 1.1 2.0, p value 0.01) and being male as compared to female 12.6 (8.8 18.0, p value 0.001). Illiteracy was significantly associated with tobacco use. Population attributable percentage of tobacco use increases steadily as the gap between no formal Education and level of education widens. CONCLUSION: There was a positive association between tobacco use and rural area of residence, male gender and low education levels. Low education could be a proxy for low awareness and consumer information on tobacco products. As Public health practitioners we should inform the general public especially the illiterate about the adverse health consequences of tobacco use. Counter advertisement for tobacco use, through mass media particularly radio and television, emphasizing the harmful effects of tobacco on human health is very much needed.},

Understanding national trends in prevalence and consumption is critical for prioritizing action and evaluating tobacco control progress.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nOBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of daily smoking by age and sex and the number of cigarettes per smoker per day for 187 countries from 1980 to 2012.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nDESIGN: Nationally representative sources that measured tobacco use (n = 2102 country-years of data) were systematically identified. Survey data that did not report daily tobacco smoking were adjusted using the average relationship between different definitions. Age-sex-country-year observations (n = 38,315) were synthesized using spatial-temporal gaussian process regression to model prevalence estimates by age, sex, country, and year. Data on consumption of cigarettes were used to generate estimates of cigarettes per smoker per day.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Modeled age-standardized prevalence of daily tobacco smoking by age, sex, country, and year; cigarettes per smoker per day by country and year.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nRESULTS: Global modeled age-standardized prevalence of daily tobacco smoking in the population older than 15 years decreased from 41.2\{\%\} (95\{\%\} uncertainty interval [UI], 40.0\{\%\}-42.6\{\%\}) in 1980 to 31.1\{\%\} (95\{\%\} UI, 30.2\{\%\}-32.0\{\%\}; P {\textbackslash}textless .001) in 2012 for men and from 10.6\{\%\} (95\{\%\} UI, 10.2\{\%\}-11.1\{\%\}) to 6.2\{\%\} (95\{\%\} UI, 6.0\{\%\}-6.4\{\%\}; P {\textbackslash}textless .001) for women. Global modeled prevalence declined at a faster rate from 1996 to 2006 (mean annualized rate of decline, 1.7\{\%\}; 95\{\%\} UI, 1.5\{\%\}-1.9\{\%\}) compared with the subsequent period (mean annualized rate of decline, 0.9\{\%\}; 95\{\%\} UI, 0.5\{\%\}-1.3\{\%\}; P = .003). Despite the decline in modeled prevalence, the number of daily smokers increased from 721 million (95\{\%\} UI, 700 million-742 million) in 1980 to 967 million (95\{\%\} UI, 944 million-989 million; P {\textbackslash}textless .001) in 2012. Modeled prevalence rates exhibited substantial variation across age, sex, and countries, with rates below 5\{\%\} for women in some African countries to more than 55\{\%\} for men in Timor-Leste and Indonesia. The number of cigarettes per smoker per day also varied widely across countries and was not correlated with modeled prevalence.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Since 1980, large reductions in the estimated prevalence of daily smoking were observed at the global level for both men and women, but because of population growth, the number of smokers increased significantly.

	abstract = {Background: Our aim was to calculate the global burden of disease and risk factors for 2001, to examine regional trends from 1990 to 2001, and to provide a starting point for the analysis of the Disease Control Priorities Project (DCPP). Methods: We calculated mortality, incidence, prevalence, and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) for 136 diseases and injuries, for seven income/geographic country groups. To assess trends, we re-estimated all-cause mortality for 1990 with the same methods as for 2001. We estimated mortality and disease burden attributable to 19 risk factors. Findings: About 56 million people died in 2001. Of these, 10??6 million were children, 99\% of whom lived in low-and-middle-income countries. More than half of child deaths in 2001 were attributable to acute respiratory infections, measles, diarrhoea, malaria, and HIV/AIDS. The ten leading diseases for global disease burden were perinatal conditions, lower respiratory infections, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, HIV/AIDS, diarrhoeal diseases, unipolar major depression, malaria, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and tuberculosis. There was a 20\% reduction in global disease burden per head due to communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional conditions between 1990 and 2001. Almost half the disease burden in low-and-middle-income countries is now from non-communicable diseases (disease burden per head in Sub-Saharan Africa and the low-and-middle-income countries of Europe and Central Asia increased between 1990 and 2001). Undernutrition remains the leading risk factor for health loss. An estimated 45\% of global mortality and 36\% of global disease burden are attributable to the joint hazardous effects of the 19 risk factors studied. Uncertainty in all-cause mortality estimates ranged from around 1\% in high-income countries to 15-20\% in Sub-Saharan Africa. Uncertainty was larger for mortality from specific diseases, and for incidence and prevalence of non-fatal outcomes. Interpretation: Despite uncertainties about mortality and burden of disease estimates, our findings suggest that substantial gains in health have been achieved in most populations, countered by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa and setbacks in adult mortality in countries of the former Soviet Union. Our results on major disease, injury, and risk factor causes of loss of health, together with information on the cost-effectiveness of interventions, can assist in accelerating progress towards better health and reducing the persistent differentials in health between poor and rich countries. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The contribution of this paper lies in developing a structural model to facilitate empirical analyses directed toward assessing the role of various potential determinants of the spatial distribution of FDI. The model presented in this paper combines elements of the trade literature on imperfect competition with the strategy literature on multinationals to derive an explicit solution for the distribution of FDI in terms of its potential determinants, allowing FDI to serve both the host-country market and the export market. It allows for product differentiation between final products by brand name as well as the country of origin and takes into account an environment that is subject to uncertainty in the appropriation of the potential revenue.

This article describes the gologit2 program for generalized ordered logit models. gologit2 is inspired by Vincent Fu's gologit routine (Stata Technical Bulletin Reprints 8: 160-164) and is backward compatible with it but offers several additional powerful options. A major strength of gologit2 is that it can fit three special cases of the generalized model: the proportional odds/parallel-lines model, the partial proportional odds model, and the logistic regression model. Hence, gologit2 can fit models that are less restrictive than the parallel-lines models fitted by ologit (whose assumptions are often violated) but more parsimonious and interpretable than those fitted by a nonordinal method, such as multinomial logistic regression (i.e., mlogit). Other key advantages of gologit2 include support for linear constraints, survey data estimation, and the computation of estimated probabilities via the predict command.},

	abstract = {Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects approximately 3 million people in the UK. An 8-week pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) course is rec-ommended under current guidelines. However, studies show that initial benefits diminish over time. Objective We present here an economic evaluation con-ducted alongside a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a low-intensity maintenance programme over a time horizon of 1 year delivered in UK primary and secondary care settings. Methods Patients with COPD who completed at least 60 \% of a standard 8-week PR programme were ran-domised to a 2-h maintenance session at 3, 6 and 9 months (n = 73) or treatment as usual (n = 75). Outcomes were change in Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) score, EQ-5D-based QALYs, cost (price year 2014) to the UK NHS and social services over the 12 months following initial PR, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results At 12 months, incremental cost to the NHS and social services was -{\textbackslash}pounds204.04 (95 \% CI -{\textbackslash}pounds1522 to {\textbackslash}pounds1114). Incremental CRQ and QALY gains were -0.007 (-0.461 to 0.447) and ?0.015 (-0.050 to 0.079), respectively. Based on point estimates, PR maintenance therefore dominates treatment as usual from the perspective of the NHS and social services in terms of cost per QALY gained. Whether it is cost effective in terms of CRQ depends on whether the {\textbackslash}pounds204 per patient could be reinvested elsewhere to a CRQ gain of greater than 0.007. However, there is much decision uncertainty: 95 \% CIs around increments did not exclude zero, and there is a 72.9 \% (72.5 \%) probability that the ICER is below {\textbackslash}pounds20,000 ({\textbackslash}pounds30,000) per QALY. Conclusion Future research should explore whether more intensive maintenance regimens offer benefit to patients at reasonable cost. Key Points for Decision Makers Pulmonary rehabilitation is recommended for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients; most courses are around 2 months in length. The effectiveness and cost effectiveness of longer term maintenance programmes is unknown. A 2-h maintenance session at 3, 6 and 9 months after initial pulmonary rehabilitation programme has a 72.9 \% (72.5 \%) probability of yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio below {\textbackslash}pounds20,000 ({\textbackslash}pounds30,000) per QALY gained.},

The objective of the paper is to identify some of the determinants of foreign investment of the largest MNCs operating in this industry. The list of the largest MNCs has been compiled using company websites and data is available for 41 developing economies for which at least two MNCs have an office (branch and/or affiliate).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prevention and control of disease and injury require information about the leading medical causes of illness and exposures or risk factors. The assessment of the public-health importance of these has been hampered by the lack of common methods to investigate the overall, worldwide burden. The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) provides a standardised approach to epidemiological assessment and uses a standard unit, the disability-adjusted life year (DALY), to aid comparisons. METHODS: DALYs for each age-sex group in each GBD region for 107 disorders were calculated, based on the estimates of mortality by cause, incidence, average age of onset, duration, and disability severity. Estimates of the burden and prevalence of exposure in different regions of disorders attributable to malnutrition, poor water supply, sanitation and personal and domestic hygiene, unsafe sex, tobacco use, alcohol, occupation, hypertension, physical inactivity, use of illicit drugs, and air pollution were developed. FINDINGS: Developed regions account for 11.6\% of the worldwide burden from all causes of death and disability, and account for 90.2\% of health expenditure worldwide. Communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional disorders explain 43.9\%; non-communicable causes 40.9\%; injuries 15.1\%; malignant neoplasms 5.1\%; neuropsychiatric conditions 10.5\%; and cardiovascular conditions 9.7\% of DALYs worldwide. The ten leading specific causes of global DALYs are, in descending order, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, perinatal disorders, unipolar major depression, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, tuberculosis, measles, road-traffic accidents, and congenital anomalies. 15.9\% of DALYs worldwide are attributable to childhood malnutrition and 6.8\% to poor water, and sanitation and personal and domestic hygiene. INTERPRETATION: The three leading contributors to the burden of disease are communicable and perinatal disorders affecting children. The substantial burdens of neuropsychiatric disorders and injuries are under-recognised. The epidemiological transition in terms of DALYs has progressed substantially in China, Latin America and the Caribbean, other Asia and islands, and the middle eastern crescent. If the burdens of disability and death are taken into account, our list differs substantially from other lists of the leading causes of death. DALYs provide a common metric to aid meaningful comparison of the burden of risk factors, diseases, and injuries. PIP: The Global Burden of Disease Study used the disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) to compare death and disability from various disorders in developing and developed countries. In 1990, developing countries carried almost 90\% of the global disease burden yet were recipients of only 10\% of global health care funding. The highest disease burdens were in sub-Saharan Africa (21.4\% of global total) and India (20.9\%). Communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional disorders (group 1 causes) predominated in sub-Saharan Africa (65.9\% of burden), while noncommunicable diseases (group 2 causes) accounted for 80\% of the burden in established market economies; injuries (group 3) did not differ substantially across regions. The ratio of group 2 to group 1 disorders can be used as a measure of the epidemiologic transition. Group 2 disorders already surpass group 1 disorders in China, Latin America, and the Caribbean. On a global level, group 1, 2, and 3 causes accounted for 43.9\%, 40.9\%, and 15.1\%, respectively, of DALYs. Overall, the top 3 causes of DALYs in 1990 were lower respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, and perinatal disorders (low birth weight and birth asphyxia or birth trauma). In developed countries, these causes were ischemic heart disease, unipolar major depression, and cerebrovascular diseases. Malnutrition was the risk factor responsible for the greatest loss of DALYs (15.9\%), followed by poor water supply, sanitation, and personal hygiene (6.8\%). eng},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Smoking and passive smoking are collectively the biggest preventable cause of death in Bangladesh, with major public health burden of morbidity, disability, mortality and community costs. The available studies of tobacco use in Bangladesh, however, do not necessarily employ nationally representative samples needed to monitor the problem at a national scale. This paper examines the prevalence and patterns of tobacco use among adults in Bangladesh and the changes over time using large nationally representative comparable surveys. METHODS: Using data from two enumerations of the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Bangladesh Project conducted in 2009 and 2012, prevalence estimates are obtained for all tobacco products by socio-economic determinants and sample types of over 90,000 individuals drawn from over 30,000 households. Household level sample weights are used to obtain nationally representative prevalence estimates and standard errors. Statistical tests of difference in the estimates between two time periods are based on a logistic regression model that accounts for the complex sampling design. Using a multinomial logit model, the time trend in tobacco use status is identified to capture the effects of macro level determinants including changes in tobacco control policies. RESULTS: Between 2009 and 2012, overall tobacco use went down from 42.4\% to 36.3\%. The decline is more pronounced with respect to smokeless tobacco use than smoking. The prevalence of exclusive cigarette smoking went up from 7.2\% to 10.6\%; exclusive bidi smoking remained stable at around 2\%; while smoking both cigarette and bidi went down from 4.6\% to 1.8\%; exclusive smokeless tobacco use went down from 20.2\% to 16.9\%; and both smokeless tobacco use and smoking went down from 8.4\% to 5.1\%. In general, the prevalence of tobacco use is higher among men, increases from younger to older age groups, and is higher among poorer people. Smoking prevalence is the highest among the slum population, followed by the tribal population, the national population and the border area population, suggesting greater burden of tobacco use among the disadvantaged groups. CONCLUSIONS: The overall decline in tobacco use can be viewed as a structural shift in the tobacco market in Bangladesh from low value products such as bidi and smokeless tobacco to high value cigarettes, which is expected with the growth in income and purchasing power of the general population. Despite the reduction in overall tobacco use, the male smoking prevalence in Bangladesh is still high at 37\%. The world average of daily smoking among men is 31.1\%. The Tobacco Control Act 2005 and the Amendment have yet to make a significant impact in curbing tobacco usage in Bangladesh. The findings in this paper further suggest that the tobacco control policies in Bangladesh need to include targeted interventions to restrain the use of particular types of tobacco products among specific demographic and socio-economic groups of the population, such as smoked tobacco among men, smokeless tobacco among women, and both smoked and smokeless tobacco among those living in rural areas, those in low socio-economic status and those belonging to the tribal and the slum population.},

Intraregional foreign participation creates negative intraindustry and positive interindustry externalities. Furthermore, the estimations identify negative intraindustry externalities across regions and positive spatial interindustry FDI externalities. In addition, the estimations identify three different regional characteristics that have a negative or positive effect on spatial externalities from FDI. © 2008 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.},

	abstract = {The typical narrative regarding the evolution of world trade prior to World War II refers to a secular rise starting around 1870 and a subsequent collapse beginning in 1914. This narrative, however, is based on measures of trade openness that do not fully take into account purchasing power differences across countries. Due to lack of alternative data, the measures employed in the existing literature are typically based on non-PPP-adjusted trade data denominated by PPP-adjusted GDP data. The present paper seeks to resolve this inconsistency by constructing new trade share estimates for 62 countries, representing 90\% of world GDP, for the period from 1870 to 1949. Our estimates combine historical import and export figures with non-PPP-adjusted GDP values that we estimate via the short-cut method. Our estimates confirm qualitatively the narrative of a dramatic rise and fall of world trade over this period. Yet, they indicate that this rise and fall was quantitatively much more pronounced. We find that trade shares were on average 38\% higher than previously documented and the world's level of trade openness in 1913 was comparable to that in 1974. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACr There is concern about the increasing tobacco consumption in developing countries, especially in urban communities. Little information is available on the prevalence and determinants of smoking in black townships in South Africa. We therefore conducted a survey of the smoking practices in three such townships in Cape Town, in which 673 higher primary schoolchildren and 1320 adults were interviewed using a WHO questionnaire translated into Xhosa. Results were analysed using a multiple logistic regression model. In higher primary schoolpupils, boys smoked much more than girls [adjusted odds ratio (ORa) = 17-8; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 5 2-60 9]; and smoking prevalence increased with age (ORa = 1 6; 95\% CI: 1 3-1 9), peer pressure (ORa = 4-4; 95\% CI: 1 9-6 9), and poor health knowledge (ORa = 3-1; 95\% CI: 1 -6-58). In adults, smoking prevalence was 53\% in men compared to 6\% in women. In men, an urban experience of 6 or more years was significantly associated with smoking (ORa = 1 9; 95\% CI: 1 2-3-0) after adjustment for age, health knowledge and occupation. No association was found between level of education and smoking prevalence. Men in higher paid occupations smoked more than those in low paid occupations (ORa= 1 7; 95\% CI: 1 0-2-8). Unemployment, however, was not associated with smoking prevalence. The findings emphasise the need for primary prevention of smoking in women and boys. Urbanisation and increased earning power appear to boost tobacco consumption in the absence of active anti-smoking efforts. There is growing concern about increasing tobacco consumption in the developing countries of the world.' 2The detrimental effects ofsmoking on health have been extensively documented3 and there remains a need to design and implement anti-smoking campaigns. However the success of any intervention depends to a great extent on a thorough understanding of the determinants of the high risk behaviour.4 High smoking rates in black men in South Africa have been reported.5'6 However there is scanty information regarding the determinants of smoking in this group. Potential factors associated with smoking include urbanisation, improved earning capacity, targeted advertising and a general social acceptance of smoking in men. As urbanisation is a major development force in southern Africa,7 it is of importance to investigate the impact of urbanisation on smoking behaviour. In this paper we examine the determinants of cigarette smoking in the black township population of Cape Town with a view to the design and implementation of appropriate interventions. Methods Using World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines,8 a survey was conducted in the school and adult population of the black townships in Cape Town. Three areas were selected for the survey in order to reflect differing levels of urbanisation: Langa (a settled urban community), Khayelitsha (a community of intermediate urban status), and Site B (a population of recent arrivals in an urban environment). For the school survey, one higher primary school was selected in each township. In the adult survey a random cluster sample (24 clusters of -18 people) was taken in each area. Details of the sampling and interviewing procedures are summarised elsewhere.9},

First, there is a notable deviation of FDI in Russia among regions; however, a clear geographical pattern, similar to that in Central and Eastern European countries and China, can not be observed. Second, resource endowments, market factors and social development factors, to which the preceding studies attach importance as determinants for the regional selection of FDI, also proved to have high significance and explanatory power in the empirical analysis. In addition, it has been suggested that climate and favourable regionally discriminatory FDI measures are possible investment factors. Third, evidence suggesting that the Russian financial crisis in 1998 had a statistically significant influence on the decision-making process of foreign investors was not found in this analysis.},

Using data from the pre-World War I, the interwar, and the post-war periods, we find that the main result of Frankel and Romer is confirmed throughout the whole century: countries that trade more as a proportion of their GDP have higher incomes even after controlling for the endogeneity of trade. We also find that the OLS estimate of trade's effect on income is biased downwards in almost every sample year.

	abstract = {An inverse relationship between smoking and body weight has been documented in the medical literature, but the effect of cigarette smoking on obesity remains inconclusive. In addition, the evidence is mixed on whether rising obesity rates are an unintended consequence of successful anti-smoking policies. This study re-examines these relationships using data from China, the largest consumer and manufacturer of tobacco in the world that is also experiencing a steady rise in obesity rates. We focus on the impact of the total number of cigarettes smoked per day on individuals' body mass index (BMI) and on the likelihood of being overweight and obese. Instrumental variables estimation is used to correct for the endogeneity of cigarette smoking. We find a moderate negative and significant relationship between cigarette smoking and BMI. Smoking is also negatively related to being overweight and obese, but the marginal effects are small and statistically insignificant for being obese. Quantile regression analyses reveal that the association between smoking and BMI is quite weak among subjects whose BMIs are at the high end of the distribution but are considerably stronger among subjects in the healthy weight range. Ordered probit regression analyses also confirm these findings. Our results thus reconcile an inverse average effect of smoking on body weight with the absence of any significant effect on obesity. From a policy perspective these findings suggest that, while smoking cessation may lead to moderate weight gain among subjects of healthy weight, the effects on obese subjects are modest and should not be expected to lead to a large increase in obesity prevalence rates. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

These data are combined with data on export value and volume. I find a fairly consistent positive relationship between exports and new HIV infections: doubling exports leads to a 10\%---70\% increase in new HIV infections. Consistent with theory, this relationship is larger in areas with higher baseline HIV prevalence. I interpret the result as suggesting that increased exports increase the movement of people (trucking), which increases sexual contacts. Consistent with this interpretation, the effect is larger for export growth than for income growth per se and is larger in areas with more extensive road networks.},

	abstract = {This study investigates socioeconomic status (SES) differences in health among the aged in Germany and the United States. Intra-elderly age differences in the SES-health gradient are also examined. The study uses data from two national telephone surveys conducted in Germany (N=682) and the United States (N=608) using probability samples of non-institutionalised persons 60 years or older. In addition to the traditional indicators of SES (education, income and occupational status), two alternative indicators (assets and home ownership) are utilised. Self-rated health, depression (CES-D) and functional limitations are introduced as health indicators. Results of multiple logistic regression analyses show that income is the best SES predictor of the three health measures among the aged in Germany, whereas education, occupational prestige, assets, and home ownership are not consistently related to health. Respective analyses of the US data demonstrate weaker and less consistent associations of health measures with SES indicators. Consequently, there is a higher percentage of explained variance in health by SES among the aged in Germany compared to the United States. The data also show that social inequalities in health tend to diminish at older ages in the United States, but such disparities vary only slightly by age in Germany. In conclusion, although SES health differences are observed among the elderly in both countries, they are more pronounced in Germany than in the United States where effects are restricted to younger old age. One interpretation of this finding points to higher selective mortality of middle and early old age groups with a low SES in the United States due to stronger health-related deprivation.},

Little has been done to test this theory empirically. This paper attempts to rectify this situation by considering not only bilateral determinants, but also spatially weighted third-country determinants of foreign direct investment (FDI). Since the dependency among host markets is particularly related to multinationals' trade between them, we use trade costs (distances) as spatial weights. Using panel data on U.S. industries and host countries observed over the 1989-1999 period, we estimate a "complex FDI" version of the knowledge-capital model of U.S. outward FDI by various recently developed spatial panel data generalized moments (GM) estimators. We find that third-country effects are significant, lending support to the existence of various modes of complex FDI. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Afterwards, the paper performs an explanatory factor analysis to reduce to a manageable number of factors the vast array of FDI determinants considered in the literature. The econometric analysis carried out reveals that factors such as economic potential, labour conditions and competitiveness are important for attracting FDI both at aggregate and sectoral levels; on the contrary, market size is not relevant at all as booster of FDI. Finally, the analysis is extended to take account of the presence of spatial effects, the results showing the existence of negative geographical spillovers associated to the economic potential and competitiveness factors. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Data from general population surveys (n = 1483 to 9151) in nine European countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) were analyzed to cross-validate the selection of questionnaire items for the SF-12 Health Survey and scoring algorithms for 12-item physical and mental component summary measures. In each country, multiple regression methods were used to select 12 SF-36 items that best reproduced the physical and mental health summary scores for the SF-36 Health Survey. Summary scores then were estimated with 12 items in three ways: using standard (U.S.-derived) SF-12 items and scoring algorithms; standard items and country-specific scoring; and country-specific sets of 12 items and scoring. Replication of the 36-item summary measures by the 12-item summary measures was then evaluated through comparison of mean scores and the strength of product-moment correlations. Product-moment correlations between SF-36 summary measures and SF-12 summary measures (standard and country- specific) were very high, ranging from 0.94-0.96 and 0.94-0.97 for the physical and mental summary measures, respectively. Mean 36-item summary measures and comparable 12-item summary measures were within 0.0 to 1.5 points (median = 0.5 points) in each country and were comparable across age groups. Because of the high degree of correspondence between summary physical and mental health measures estimated using the SF-12 and SF-36, it appears that the SF-12 will prove to be a practical alternative to the SF-36 in these countries, for purposes of large group comparisons in which the focus is on overall physical and mental health outcomes.},

This report focuses on risk factor levels and their relations to CVD rates. DESIGN: Successive surveys on smoking habits, blood pressure (BP), serum total cholesterol (TC), weight and height were conducted in independent random samples of the same populations early (1987-1988) and late (1992-1993) in the study period, by the methodology and criteria of the WHO MONICA project. Associations between risk levels and CVD rates were also assessed by correlation analysis. RESULTS: In general, the mean level of BP in the populations studied was high by international standards. Serum TC and body mass index (BMI) were low compared with the world average. There were significant geographic variations in CVD risk levels, being higher in the north and lower in the south, which correlated with the north-south difference of CVD event rates. CONCLUSIONS: The Sino-MONICA study has established the feasibility of long-term monitoring of CVD events and risk factors with international standardized methods in Chinese communities. The results will have significance in curbing the CVD epidemic not only in China, but also internationally.},

Focusing on the relationship between trade and investment, we argue that international trade agreements---GATT/WTOand preferential trade agreements (PTAs)---provide mechanisms for making commitments to foreign investors about the treatment of their assets, thus reassuring investors and increasing investment. These international commitments are more credible than domestic policy choices, because reneging on them is more costly. Statistical analyses for 122 developing countries from 1970 to 2000 support this argument. Developing countries that belong to theWTOand participate in more PTAs experience greater FDI inflows than otherwise, controlling for many factors including domestic policy preferences and taking into account possible endogeneity. Joining international trade agreements allows developing countries to attractmore FDI and thus increase economic growth.},

This article examines the diet transition as the absent factor within debates on liberalizing trade and commerce. We describe the evolution of trade agreements, noting those relevant to food. We review the association between trade liberalization and changes in the global dietary and disease profile. We illustrate some of the complex linkages between trade liberalization and the 'diet transition', illustrated by factors such as foreign direct investment, supermarketization and cultural change. Finally, we offer three scenarios for change, suggesting the need for more effective 'food governance' and engagement by public health advocates in policy making in the food and agriculture arena.},

The data from these surveys provided information on 213,807 respondents aged 18 years or above that were divided into 4 pooled datasets according to their sex and country income group. The overall proportion of current smokers, as well as the proportion by each relevant demographic and socioeconomic determinant, was calculated within each of the pooled datasets, and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between current smoking and these determinants.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nRESULTS: The odds of smoking were not equal in all demographic or socioeconomic groups. Some factors were fairly stable across the four datasets studied: for example, individuals were more likely to smoke if they had little or no education, regardless of if they were male or female, or lived in a low or a middle income country. Nevertheless, other factors, notably age and wealth, showed a differential effect on smoking by sex or country income level. While women in the low-income country group were twice as likely to smoke if they were in the lowest wealth quintile compared with the highest, the association was absent in the middle-income country group.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nCONCLUSION: Information on how smoking is distributed among low- or middle-income countries will allow policy makers to tailor future policies, and target the most vulnerable populations.},

Initiated with a partial sample in 1989, the full survey runs from 1991 to 2011, and this issue documents the CHNS history. The CHNS cohort includes new household formation and replacement communities and households; all household members are studied. Furthermore, in-depth community data are collected. The sample began with eight provinces and added a ninth, Heilongjiang, in 1997 and three autonomous cities, Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing, in 2011. The in-depth community contextual measures have allowed us to create a unique measure of urbanicity that captures major dimensions of modernization across all 288 communities currently in the CHNS sample. The standardized, validated urbanicity measure captures the changes in 12 dimensions: population density; economic activity; traditional markets; modern markets; transportation infrastructure; sanitation; communications; housing; education; diversity; health infrastructure; and social services. Each is based on numerous measures applicable to each dimension. They are used jointly and separately in hundreds of studies.},

Higher per capita incomes, through steady and stable economic growth, increase a nation's capacity to purchase the necessary economic goods and services that promote health. In this paper, we review the conceptual and empirical linkages between poverty and poor health in both developing and developed countries. The empirical evidence is overwhelming that poverty, measured at the level of societies as well as individuals, is causally related to poor health of societies and individuals, respectively. Recent macroeconomic research has also drawn attention to the role of health as a form of human capital that is vital for achieving economic stability. In particular, attention has been drawn toward the ways in which unhealthy societies impede the process of economic development. However, the reciprocal connection between economic prosperity and improved health is neither automatic nor universal. Other features of society, such as the equality in the distribution of the national wealth, seem to matter as well for improving average population health and especially for reducing inequalities in health. We conclude by arguing for a need to reexamine the way in which health is conceptualized within the macroeconomic development framework.},

New evidence on the time paths of economic growth, physical capital investment, and openness around episodes of trade policy liberalization is also presented. Analysis based on the new data set suggests that over the 1950-98 period, countries that liberalized their trade regimes experienced average annual growth rates that were about 1.5 percentage points higher than before liberalization. Postliberalization investment rates rose 1.5-2.0 percentage points, confirming past findings that liberalization fosters growth in part through its effect on physical capital accumulation. Liberalization raised the average trade to GDP ratio by roughly 5 percentage points, suggesting that trade policy liberalization did indeed raise the actual level of openness of liberalizers. However, these average effects mask large differences across countries. © The Author 2008.

METHODS: The study design was cross-sectional based on a random sample of 3000 children in each country, aged 2 to 17 years, totalling 15,000 in 1984 and 15,000 in 1996. The data were collected by mailed questionnaires. QoL was analysed for three spheres of life: external, interpersonal, personal including both factual and perceived variables. The external sphere represented the socio-economic conditions for the child's family, the interpersonal sphere the structure and the function of the child's social networks and the personal sphere the psychological well-being of the child. RESULTS: The total QoL for Nordic children from 1984 to 1996 increased, but there were differences in the development of QoL between the countries. The objective QoL became better, at the same time the subjective QoL worsened, except in Denmark and Iceland. The external QoL became better, whereas the interpersonal QoL was nearly unchanged but there were differences in the development between countries. The personal QoL worsened slightly except for children in Iceland. The ranking between countries changed. Danish children had the highest subjective and Norwegian children the highest objective and external QoL. Swedish children had the highest personal QoL. Children 7-12 years had the highest QoL. Girls had a tendency to higher QoL in all ages. CONCLUSION: Nordic children still enjoy a high standard of living in spite of economic constraints, and the prerequisites for a high QoL are fulfilled. Further research is suggested for clarifying the complex background of these results.},

	abstract = {Ukraine is the second most populous of the former Soviet Republics and since transition its economy has fared even more poorly than Russia. Although the impact of the collapse of the former Soviet Union on health in Russia has been investigated, little is known of its impact in other post-Soviet republics. We report a cross-sectional study undertaken in Ukraine in March 2000. A multi-stage random sampling technique was used and 1600 interviews completed (72\% response rate) with a representative national sample of Ukrainian adults. We investigated socioeconomic and psychosocial determinants of self-perceived health, which has been shown to be a valid and reliable measure of overall health and predictive of mortality. Odds ratios for less than good physical health were calculated using logistic regression. The self-rated health of Ukrainians was poor, 25\% of men and 43\% of women rated their health as poor or very poor. This is worse than levels recorded in Russia and considerably worse than levels seen in western Europe. Marked gender, geographical and socioeconomic inequalities in health were recorded. Women are at increased risk of poor self-rated health compared with men (OR 3.58, 2.50-5.14) as are women living in villages compared with those in cities (OR 3.24, 1.30-8.07). Socioeconomic factors including poor material situation (OR 1.64, 1.01-2.67), and psychosocial factors including low control over life (OR 1.89, 1.15-3.11) were identified as independent health determinants. Control over life was found to account for the negative impact of low social position on health. Good family relations protected against poor health. The findings suggest that a decrease in control, arising from an increasingly uncertain political and economic environment, a reduction in material wealth and the stress of change may all have contributed to the decline in life expectancy seen with transition. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Measurements were recorded in 1991, 1993, 1997, 2000, 2004 and 2006. Household income data in 2006 were included in the analysis of the impact of socio-economic status on the prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents. BMI cut-offs recommended by IOTF were used to define childhood overweight and obesity, as well as the Chinese cut-offs. The Cochrane-Mantel-Haenszel test for trend was used to examine the temporal trends in the prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity. Generalised estimating equations analysis was performed to assess the changes in BMI during the study period after adjusting for age, sex, region and income.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nRESULTS: In Chinese children and adolescents mean BMI steadily increased from 17.4 kg/m(2) (95\% CI: 17.3-17.5) in 1991 to 18.3 kg/m(2) (95\% CI: 18.1-18.5) in 2006, after adjusting for age, sex, region and income level. There was a corresponding increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity from 5.2\% in 1991 to 13.2\% in 2006. The greatest increase occurred among male children and adolescents in whom the prevalence of excess body weight tripled from 4.8\% in 1991 to 15.4\% in 2006, compared with 5.4\% and 11.0\% in females over the same period. In 2006, those from higher income families tended to have the highest prevalence of overweight and obesity.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of overweight and obesity among Chinese children and adolescents has increased steadily over the past 15 years with the increase being apparent in all age, sex and income groups.

The mean reported ages of first smoking in current smokers were compared between 10-year birth cohorts.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nRESULTS: Between 1992 and 2003, smoking prevalence doubled among women from 6.9\% (95\% CI 6.3\% to 7.6\%) to 14.8\% (13.9\% to 15.7\%) and increased among men from 57.4\% (95\% CI 56.0\% to 58.8\%) to 62.6\% (61.1\% to 64.1\%). In both sexes, the rise was significantly greater in the least educated, markedly so in women (a doubling vs a 1.5-fold rise in the most educated). Although prevalence of smoking among women was considerably higher in Moscow and St Petersburg than in rural areas, the dramatic threefold increase in prevalence in rural women was significantly greater than in the main cities (36\%, p{\textbackslash}textless0.001). The mean age of first smoking was significantly lower in women born after 1960, but in men it was stable between cohorts.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS: For the first time, it has been shown unequivocally that smoking among women increased markedly during the transition to a market economy in Russia. The already high prevalence of smoking among men has continued to rise. These changes are likely to reflect the activity of the tobacco industry and provide further evidence of the harms of privatisation. Effective tobacco control policies are urgently needed.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the effect of outbound foreign direct investment (FDI) on the domestic capital stock. The first part of the paper shows that only about 20 percent of the value of assets owned by U.S. affiliates abroad is financed by cross-border flows of capital from the United States. An additional 18 per cent represents retained earnings attributable to U.S. investors. The rest is financed locally by foreign debt and equity. The second part of the paper analyzes data for the major industrial countries of the OECD and finds that each dollar of cross- border flow of foreign direct investment reduces domestic investment by approximately one dollar. This dollar for dollar displacement of domestic investment by outbound FDI is consistent with the Feldstein-Horioka picture of segmented capital markets. It suggests that while portfolio funds are largely segmented into national capital markets, direct investment can achieve cross-border capital flows. A dollar outflow of direct investment reduces domestic investment by a dollar and this is not offset by a change in international portfolio investment. This ability of foreign direct investment to circumvent the segmented national capital markets also appears in the expanded use of foreign debt and equity capital to finance the capital accumulation of foreign affiliates of U.S. firms. Taken together, these estimates suggest that each dollar of foreign assets acquired by U.S. foreign affiliates reduces the U.S. domestic capital stock by between 20 cents and 38 cents.},

Random slopes were used to investigate spatiotemporal variation and the proportion of variance explained was used to assess the relative importance of geographical region, urbanization, mean temperature, local diabetes prevalence, behavioral risk factors and relevant biomarkers.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nRESULTS: Diabetes mortality tended to reduce between 2006 and 2012, though there appeared to be an increase in diabetes mortality in urban (age standardized rate (ASR) 2006-2012: 10.5-13.6) and rural (ASR 10.8-13.0) areas in the Southwest region. A Median Rate Ratio of 1.47, slope variance of 0.006 (SE 0.001) and covariance of 0.268 (SE 0.007) indicated spatiotemporal variation. Fully adjusted models accounted for 37 \% of this geographical variation, with diabetes mortality higher in the Northwest (RR 2.55, 95 \% CI 1.74, 3.73) and Northeast (RR 2.68, 95 \% CI 1.70, 4.21) compared with the South. Diabetes mortality was higher in urbanized areas (RR tertile 3 versus tertile 1 ('RRt3vs1') 1.39, 95 \% CI 1.17, 1.66), with higher mean body mass index (RRt3vs1 1.46, 95 \% CI 1.18, 1.80) and with higher average temperatures (RR 1.05 95 \% CI 1.03, 1.08). Diabetes mortality was lower where consumption of alcohol was excessive (RRt3vs1 0.84, 95 \% CI 0.72, 0.99).

The importance of foreign inflows is not limited to developing countries; developed and emerging economies also attract foreign inflows to supplement their resources to sustain growth. The importance of foreign inflow in Pakistan is very well acknowledged and documented, however the affect of these inflows on poor people of Pakistan remains unanswered. This paper is an attempt to fill this gap by studying the impact of foreign inflows on poverty reduction in Pakistan through the channel of health, education and other indicators related to human development. Our foreign inflow variable consists of Foreign Direct Investment, Remittances and Foreign Assistance. Using ARDL approach to co-integration on time series data for the period 1972 to 2008, we found that foreign inflows as a whole have increased poverty levels in Pakistan. At disaggregated levels, we found that foreign assistance is the major component of inflows which is responsible for the positive relationship between inflows and poverty. We also found positive relationship between poverty and infant mortality and foreign inflows and female enrolment. The relationship suggests that increase in foreign inflows would not only increase poverty but also would increase infant mortality through indirect channel. The impact of inflow on female enrolment was however found to be positive.

In the 1995-96 crisis, mortality rates were about 5 to 7 percent higher in the crisis years compared to the years just prior to the crisis. This translates into a 0.4 percent increase in mortality for the elderly and a 0.06 percent increase in mortality for the very young.

	abstract = {The debate between those who see economic development and those who regard advances in medical technology as bearing major responsibility for mortality decline usually gives little attention to different stages of social change when economic or medical conditions are fixed. However, Nigerian statistics analyzed here show that very different levels of child survivorship result from different levels of maternal education in an otherwise similar socio-economic context and when there is equal access to the use of medical facilities. Indeed, maternal education in Nigeria appears to be the single most powerful determinant of the level of child mortality. The statistics come from two surveys undertaken in 1973: one of 6,606 women in Ibadan city, and the other of 1,499 women in a large area of south-west Nigeria. Proportions of children surviving are compounded into an index of child mortality to increase the frequencies in individual cells and standardize maternal age when child survivorship is correlated with a range of factors, and two component indices are also constructed to detect change over time. It is concluded that women's education in societies like that of the Yoruba in Nigeria can produce profound changes in family structure and relationships, which in their turn may influence both mortality and fertility levels. Education may well play a major role in the demographic transition and this role may help to explain the close timing of mortality and fertility transitions.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Few studies and no international comparisons have examined the impact of multiple chronic conditions on populations using a comprehensive health-related quality of life (HRQL) questionnaire. OBJECTIVE: The impact of common chronic conditions on HRQL among the general populations of eight countries was assessed. DESIGN: Cross-sectional mail and interview surveys were conducted. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Sample representatives of the adult general population of eight countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, Norway and the United States) were evaluated. Sample sizes ranged from 2031 to 4084. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported prevalence of chronic conditions (including allergies, arthritis, congestive heart failure, chronic lung disease, hypertension, diabetes, and ischemic heart disease), sociodemographic data and the SF-36 Health Survey were obtained. The SF-36 scale and summary scores were estimated for individuals with and without selected chronic conditions and compared across countries using multivariate linear regression analyses. Adjustments were made for age, gender, marital status, education and the mode of SF-36 administration. RESULTS: More than half (55.1\%) of the pooled sample reported at least one chronic condition, and 30.2\% had more than one. Hypertension, allergies and arthritis were the most frequently reported conditions. The effect of ischemic heart disease on many of the physical health scales was noteworthy, as was the impact of diabetes on general health, or arthritis on bodily pain scale scores. Arthritis, chronic lung disease and congestive heart failure were the conditions with a higher impact on SF-36 physical summary score, whereas for hypertension and allergies, HRQL impact was low (comparing with a typical person without chronic conditions, deviation scores were around -4 points for the first group and -1 for the second). Differences between chronic conditions in terms of their impact on SF-36 mental summary score were low (deviation scores ranged between -1 and -2). CONCLUSIONS: Arthritis has the highest HRQL impact in the general population of the countries studied due to the combination of a high deviation score on physical scales and a high frequency. Impact of chronic conditions on HRQL was similar roughly across countries, despite important variation in prevalence. The use of HRQL measures such as the SF-36 should be useful to better characterize the global burden of disease.},

Current smoking reduced with older age but increased with men, low socioeconomic status (SES), alcohol drinking, being never-married, pessimistic and depressive syndromes. Former smoking was associated with men, secondary school education, a middle-high income, being a businessman, being widowed, less frequencies of visiting children/relatives and friends, and worrying about children. Among 3774 never-smokers, the prevalence of passive smoking was 31.5\%, and the risk increased with women, low SES, alcohol drinking, being married, having a religious believe, and daily visiting children/relatives. There were sex differences in the associations, and an interaction effect of education and income on smoking and passive smoking.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nCONCLUSION: Older Chinese had a higher level of smoking and passive smoking than those in high income countries, reflecting China's failures in controlling smoking.

As yet, however, little research has taken place on smoking at the subnational level. The current study addresses this deficit by examining smoking in Moscow --- the city that has been at the forefront of the entry into the Russian market of transnational tobacco corporations (TTCs) in the transition period. Methods: Data were obtained from the Moscow Health Survey 2004 --- a stratified random sample of 1190 people representative of Moscow's larger population. Information was obtained about subjects' smoking habits and age of smoking initiation. Results: The prevalence of smoking was high among both men (55.5\%) and women (26.9\%), with significantly higher rates in the younger age groups. There was also a high prevalence of smoking initiation before age 15 years, especially in the youngest women (18---30 years). Logistic regression analysis showed that respondents' age, binge drinking, locus of control and economic situation were important determinants of smoking. Conclusions: Although lifestyle factors seem to underpin the generally high levels of smoking, other things, such as its high prevalence in the younger generations and the factors associated with smoking (locus of control), nevertheless suggest that the TTCs may have played an important role in the spread of smoking in transitional Russia's changing social environment.},

These guidelines include recommendations for obtaining semantic, idiomatic, experiential and conceptual equivalence in translation by using back-translation techniques and committee review, pre-testing techniques and re-examining the weights of scores. We applied these guidelines to 17 cross-cultural adaptation of HRQOL measures identified through a comprehensive literature review. The reporting standards varied across studies but agreement between raters in their ratings of the studies was substantial to almost perfect (weighted κ = 0.66-0.93) suggesting that the guidelines are easy to apply.

Public health attention has only relatively recently turned to the links between trade and investment agreements, diets and health, and there is currently no systematic monitoring of this area. This paper reviews the available evidence on the links between trade agreements, food environments and diets from an obesity and non-communicable disease (NCD) perspective. Based on the key issues identified through the review, the paper outlines an approach for monitoring the potential impact of trade agreements on food environments and obesity/NCD risks. The proposed monitoring approach encompasses a set of guiding principles, recommended procedures for data collection and analysis, and quantifiable 'minimal', 'expanded' and 'optimal' measurement indicators to be tailored to national priorities, capacity and resources. Formal risk assessment processes of existing and evolving trade and investment agreements, which focus on their impacts on food environments will help inform the development of healthy trade policy, strengthen domestic nutrition and health policy space and ultimately protect population nutrition.},

FDI flows have grown in importance relative to other forms of international capital flows, and the resulting production has increased as a share of world output, but it was still only about 8 per cent at the end of the 20th Century. The United States began its role as a foreign direct investor in the late 19th Century, while it was still a net importer of capital. It became the dominant supplier of direct investment to the rest of the world, accounting for about half of the world's stock in 1960. Since then, other countries have become major direct investors.

	abstract = {It has long been recognized that as societies modernize, they experience significant changes in their patterns of health and disease. Despite rapid modernization across the globe, there are relatively few detailed case studies of changes in health and disease within specific countries especially for sub-Saharan African countries. This paper presents evidence to illustrate the nature and speed of the epidemiological transition in Accra, Ghana's capital city. As the most urbanized and modernized Ghanaian city, and as the national center of multidisciplinary research since becoming state capital in 1877, Accra constitutes an important case study for understanding the epidemiological transition in African cities. We review multidisciplinary research on culture, development, health, and disease in Accra since the late nineteenth century, as well as relevant work on Ghana's socio-economic and demographic changes and burden of chronic disease. Our review indicates that the epidemiological transition in Accra reflects a protracted polarized model. A "protracted" double burden of infectious and chronic disease constitutes major causes of morbidity and mortality. This double burden is polarized across social class. While wealthy communities experience higher risk of chronic diseases, poor communities experience higher risk of infectious diseases and a double burden of infectious and chronic diseases. Urbanization, urban poverty and globalization are key factors in the transition. We explore the structures and processes of these factors and consider the implications for the epidemiological transition in other African cities.},

Although the silence of students from Asia, attending universities in countries such as the US, UK and Australia, has been discussed extensively in the literature, empirical studies of silence in classroom settings are still scarce. This paper aims to explain such phenomena, using participant interviews, classroom observation and detailed discourse analysis of classroom interaction. While silence was commonly used by Japanese students to save face, verbal strategies were more common among Australian students. The extensive use of face-saving silences by Japanese students was found to be negatively evaluated by Australian lecturers whose response strategies, while meant to avoid imposition on Japanese students, also resulted in lack of rapport. However, the study also finds that silence may be negotiated when shifts occur in the participants' perceptions about the footing of their own and/or their interactants. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Because stock market indices are leading indicators of economic performance, this research contributes to our understanding of the macroeconomic determinants of health. Existing studies typically rely on the unemployment rate to proxy for economic performance, but this measure captures only one of many channels through which the economic environment may influence individual health decisions. We find that large, negative monthly DJIA returns, decreases in the level of the DJIA, and stock market crashes are widely associated with worsening self-reported mental health and more cigarette smoking, binge drinking, and fatal car accidents involving alcohol.

We find that estimated relationships of traditional determinants of FDI are surprisingly robust to inclusion of terms to capture spatial interdependence, even though such interdependence is estimated to be significant.

The role of foreign trade in transition growth is analysed by applying structural economic theory. A trade perspective allows for studying economic transition as a long-term phenomenon revealing a process of structural change in detail, and positioning economic development in a wider context of phases of globalization and de-globalization (1850-1013 and from the 1950s onwards) as well as de-globalization (1914-1950). Trade developments in Eastern Asia are compared with the Latin American record in foreign trade. The article argues that the expansion of trade in the Asian region during the era of globalization backlash (1914-1950) initiated important structural changes and a new international division of labour facilitating post-war rapid economic growth. © 2005 Taylor \& Francis Group Ltd.},

METHODS: We used meta-regressions to describe ecological associations between macrolevel factors and mean BMIs across countries. Multilevel regression was used to assess the relation between macrolevel economic characteristics and individual odds of underweight and overweight relative to normal weight. RESULTS: In multilevel analyses adjusting for individual-level characteristics, a 1-standard-deviation increase in trade liberalization was associated with 13\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.76, 0.99), 17\% (95\% CI = 0.71, 0.96), 13\% (95\% CI = 0.76, 1.00), and 14\% (95\% CI = 0.75, 0.99) lower odds of underweight relative to normal weight among rural men, rural women, urban men, and urban women, respectively. Economic development was consistently associated with higher odds of overweight relative to normal weight. Among rural men, a 1-standard-deviation increase in foreign direct investment was associated with 17\% (95\% CI = 1.02, 1.35) higher odds of overweight relative to normal weight.

	abstract = {Liberals claim that countries avoid conflict in order not to disrupt economically beneficial exchange. The statement that eco- nomic integration reduces the likelihood of conflict is largely based on the effects of trade. A similar rationale can be applied to economic interdependence in the form of international capital exchange. A state is expected to avoid political risk, especially severe forms such as militarized disputes, in order not to deter investors. This study tests, on the dyadic and monadic levels of analyses, whether the liberal peace proposition holds when economic integration is operationalized as foreign direct investment (FDI) stocks, inflows, and outflows. The results for the years 1980-2000 indicate that inflows and stock of foreign investment reduce the risk of an outbreak of a fatal dispute, regardless of whether they are tested in a single equation or a simultaneous equation model. Thus, reverse causality does not bias the pacifying effect of foreign investment inflows and stock. The results also support the underlying notion of the commercial peace that militarized conflicts inhibit foreign investment. The onset of a fatal conflict reduces FDI inflows, and, if tested in a two-stage instrumental variable approach, FDI stock, the most complete measure of economic integration through foreign investment. Accounting for endogeneity seems particularly important when analyzing the link between the onset of fatal disputes and the outflow of FDI.},

	abstract = {The striking growth in the trade share of output is one of the most important developments in the world economy since World War II. Two features of this growth present challenges to the standard trade models. First, the growth is generally thought to have been generated by falling tariff barriers worldwide. But tariff barriers have decreased by only about 11 percentage points since the early 1960s; the standard models cannot explain the growth of trade without assuming counterfactually large elasticities of substitution between goods. Second, tariff declines were much larger prior to the mid 1980s than after, and yet, trade growth was smaller in the earlier period than in the later period. The standard models have difficulty generating this nonlinear feature. This paper develops a two-country dynamic Ricardian trade model that offers a resolution of these two puzzles. The key idea embedded in this model is vertical specialization, which occurs when countries specialize only in particular stages of a good's production sequence. The model generates a nonlinear trade response to tariff reductions and can explain over 50 percent of the growth of trade. Finally, the model has important implications for the gains from trade.},

It introduces first year Ph.D. students to standard graduate econometrics material from a modern perspective. It covers all the standard material necessary for understanding the principal techniques of econometrics from ordinary least squares through cointegration. The book is also distinctive in developing both time-series and cross-section analysis fully, giving the reader a unified framework for understanding and integrating results. Econometrics has many useful features and covers all the important topics in econometrics in a succinct manner. All the estimation techniques that could possibly be taught in a first-year graduate course, except maximum likelihood, are treated as special cases of GMM (generalized methods of moments). Maximum likelihood estimators for a variety of models (such as probit and tobit) are collected in a separate chapter. This arrangement enables students to learn various estimation techniques in an efficient manner. Eight of the ten chapters include a serious empirical application drawn from labor economics, industrial organization, domestic and international finance, and macroeconomics. These empirical exercises at the end of each chapter provide students a hands-on experience applying the techniques covered in the chapter. The exposition is rigorous yet accessible to students who have a working knowledge of very basic linear algebra and probability theory. All the results are stated as propositions, so that students can see the points of the discussion and also the conditions under which those results hold. Most propositions are proved in the text. For those who intend to write a thesis on applied topics, the empirical applications of the book are a good way to learn how to conduct empirical research. For the theoretically inclined, the no-compromise treatment of the basic techniques is a good preparation for more advanced theory courses.},

Neighborhood characteristics of 41,726 never and current smokers were obtained by linking participants' addresses with census tract data from the 1990 US Census. In a multilevel logistic regression model, higher neighborhood poverty was associated with increased smoking prevalence after adjusting for age, education, marital status, and occupation at the individual level, and percent high school graduate, percent college graduate, and percentage Black at the neighborhood level. Relative to women residing in neighborhoods with less than 5\% of the residents below the poverty line, the odds ratio was 1.1 (95\% confidence interval: 1.0-1.2) for women in neighborhoods with 5-9.9\% of the residents below the poverty line, 1.3 (1.2-1.4) for women in neighborhoods with 10-19.9\% of the residents below the poverty line, and 1.6 (1.5-1.8) for women in neighborhoods with 20\% or more of the residents below poverty. State of residence was also significantly associated with prevalence of current smoking. These results suggest that contextual factors (at both the neighborhood and state level) play a role in Black women's smoking behaviors over and above individual characteristics. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Growing prosperity and changing diets have contributed to a surge in obesity prevalence in China. Previous research has investigated the relationships between BMI and several socioeconomic, diet-related, and health-related variables in China. This study proposes that such relationships are likely to differ along the conditional BMI distribution, and seeks to investigate such quantile-dependent variation in effects. Special attention is paid to how variables affect the upper tail of the conditional BMI distribution where overweight and obesity concerns are more acute. Quantile regressions (QRs) and ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions are estimated. The sample consists of 3,407 adult individuals aged 20-45 who participated in the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), 2006. Substantial cross quantile variation is observed in the relationships between several key variables and BMI. The QR shows that the relationship between energy intake and BMI is largely insignificant in the lower and middle quantiles, whereas the upper quantiles show a positive and significant effect substantially larger than predicted by the least squares regression and by previous studies. This implies that a food-based strategy aimed at limiting energy intake can be an effective way to fight obesity in China. The negative association between smoking and BMI, on the other hand, is found largely to hold only in the lower and middle quantiles, with the upper tail relatively unaffected by smoking status. Thus, smoking cessation policies may not exacerbate obesity.},

The age-corrected health status of U.K. farm workers was significantly lower than the population norm, whereas Ugandans scored significantly higher (indicating good health) for physical health and lower for mental health.

	abstract = {stomach contents from a female Longman's beaked whale (Indopacetus pacificus), which stranded on the coast of Kagoshima Prefecture, Kyushu, Japan, were examined. This is the first specimen of this species from Japan and also its northern-most record. The remains collected from the stomach consisted of numerous cephalopod beaks and lenses and a large number of unidentified nematodes. Ninety-nine upper beaks and 69 lower beaks from squid species were collected from the stomach. The lower beaks were used to identify squid prey species; five species were identified: Taonius pavo, Onykia loennbergi, Onychoteuthis borealijaponica, Chiroteuthis picteti, and Histioteuthis inermis. Taonius pavo was the most common species and accounted for 84\% of the total beaks. Distribution data for these squid species suggest that this whale fed in the epipelagic to mesopelagic zones in the western North Pacific off the southern part of Japan. Stomach morphology was also examined. The presence of a main stomach with three connecting chambers and one pyloric stomach compartment was confirmed. It appears that the morphology of this species' stomach is similar to that found in Tasmacetus and Ziphius. This is the first report on the food habits, stomach anatomy, and parasites of Longman's beaked whale and contributes to a better understanding of their biology.

We argue that the attractiveness of host country locations to foreign investors depends not only upon location-specific attributes such as labor costs, but also upon the location's proximity to alternative locations. We provide theoretical rationales for how and why alternative concepts of distance might impact upon firms' FDI location decisions, and explicitly model different measures of geographic, economic and administrative distance. Empirically we illustrate the use of a number of spatial regression models with a new dataset on FDI in Chinese prefecture-cities, and have shown, in this context, that geographic distance is not the 'best' measure of distance to use. We find clear evidence of spatial dependence between the cities based upon economic distance, with weaker evidence related to administrative distance. The distinctive contribution of this paper is to emphasize that city-level policy to attract FDI is more likely to succeed if the prefecture-city is economically (and administratively) close to alternative city locations, while any policy expenditure may fail to attract FDI inflows if the prefecture-city is distant from other city locations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

A provincial analysis of its urbanisation trends shows shifting and accelerating rural-to-urban migration across the country and accompanying rapid increases in city size and population. The growing disease burden in urban areas attributable to nutrition and lifestyle choices is a major public health challenge, as are troubling disparities in health-care access, vaccination coverage, and accidents and injuries in China's rural-to-urban migrant population. Urban environmental quality, including air and water pollution, contributes to disease both in urban and in rural areas, and traffic-related accidents pose a major public health threat as the country becomes increasingly motorised. To address the health challenges and maximise the benefits that accompany this rapid urbanisation, innovative health policies focused on the needs of migrants and research that could close knowledge gaps on urban population exposures are needed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The supervision of a domestic health system in the context of the trade environment in the 21st century needs a sophisticated understanding of how trade in health services affects, and will affect, a country's health system and policy. This notion places a premium on people engaged in the health sector understanding the importance of a comprehensive outlook on trade in health services. However, establishment of systematic comparative data for amounts of trade in health services is difficult to achieve, and most trade negotiations occur in isolation from health professionals. These difficulties compromise the ability of a health system to not just minimise the risks presented by trade in health services, but also to maximise the opportunities. We consider these issues by presenting the latest trends and developments in the worldwide delivery of health-care services, using the classification provided by the World Trade Organization for the General Agreement on Trade in Services. This classification covers four modes of service delivery: cross-border supply of services; consumption of services abroad; foreign direct investment, typically to establish a new hospital, clinic, or diagnostic facility; and the movement of health professionals. For every delivery mode we discuss the present magnitude and pattern of trade, main contributors to this trade, and key issues arising.},

	abstract = {Aims: The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of smoking, smoking experimentation and future intention to smoke in the Pitkaranta district, the Republic of Karelia, Russia and Eastern Finland in the years 1995 and 2013. Methods: Cross-sectional studies were carried out among 15-year-old ninth grade adolescents in all schools in the Pitkaranta region (1995: n = 385, response rate 95\%; 2013: 182, response rate 98\%) and a sample of schools in Eastern Finland (1995: n = 2098, response rate 91\%; 2013: 635 response rate 95\%). Results: The daily smoking prevalence among adolescents did not change either in Eastern Finland or in the Pitkaranta district from 1995 to 2013. However, smoking among Finnish adolescents was more common than among Russians (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001) and boys, in general, smoke more commonly than girls (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). In Finland, early smoking experimentations declined by half among both genders but in Pitkaranta the girls' smoking experimentations tripled (relative risk 3.03, 95\% confidence interval 1.76-5.20) from 1995 to 2013. The combined effect of country and gender was significant (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001) for future intention to smoke. In Finland future intentions to smoke were very similar in boys and girls compared with obvious gender differences in Russia. Conclusions: These results suggest that more attention should be paid for programmes that consider better gender and culture-specific issues in preventing initiation of smoking and promoting an anti-smoking climate in societies.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Evidence on the relationship between cigarette prices and adult smoking in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is relatively limited. This study offers new descriptive evidence on this relationship using data from a set of 13 LMICs. METHODS: We use Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) cross-country data from approximately 200,000 participants aged 15 and older. Estimates on the relationship between prices and adult smoking were obtained from logit models of smoking participation and ordinary least squares models of conditional cigarette demand. RESULTS: Higher prices were associated with lower demand across countries, in terms of both smoking prevalence and daily number of cigarettes smoked among smokers. Our estimates suggest that the total price elasticity of cigarette demand in LMICs is approximately -0.53. We find that higher socioeconomic status (SES), represented through wealth and education effects is associated with lower chance of smoking overall, but among existing smokers, it may be associated with a larger number of cigarettes smoked. CONCLUSIONS: After controlling for a set of individual demographic and country characteristics, cigarette prices retain a significant role in shaping cigarette demand across LMICs. Because higher SES is associated with a reduced chance of smoking overall but also with increased daily consumption among current smokers, optimal tobacco tax policies in LMICs may face an added need to accommodate to shifting SES structures within the populations of these countries.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVETo determine the prevalence of diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and its risk factors in the Chinese population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSThis study was a population-based cross-sectional study of 224,251 residents aged 25-64 years in 19 provinces and areas, including cities and rural areas of the north, south, east, and middle part of China. RESULTSUsing the 1985 World Health Organization criteria, the prevalence of diabetes and IGT was 2.5 and 3.2\%, respectively, in 213,515 subjects aged 25-64 years. Two thirds (70.3\%) of the cases had newly recognized diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes in China is about three times higher than it was 10 years ago. On average, subjects with diabetes are older, have higher personal annual incomes, and more often have a family history of diabetes. They also have higher mean BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and a greater prevalence of hypertension. They perform less physical activity and have less education than people with normal oral glucose tolerance test results. Multiple logistic stepwise regression analysis shows that age, BMI (or WHR), family history of diabetes, hypertension, less physical activity, and higher annual income are independent risk factors of NIDDM, and that low education is also an independent risk factor of NIDDM in people with higher personal annual income. CONCLUSIONSThe prevalence of diabetes in China is increasing with economic development and changes from traditional to modernized lifestyle, especially where people had lower level of education and socioeconomic development. Therefore, Chinese people should attempt to retain certain features of their traditional lifestyle (physical activity, healthy food, moderate body weight). Increased knowledge of risk factors for diabetes may help to prevent a further rapid increase in the prevalence of diabetes in China.},

	abstract = {China now joins the world epidemic of childhood obesity. Because of the large disparity of environmental conditions across various sub-populations, accurate prevalence of obesity/overweight cannot be estimated by population-based approaches. Using a resident-based targeted approach, we determined the geographical distribution of childhood obesity in China and analyzed the specific factors related to the increasing prevalence of obesity in each of its ten regions. An alarming increase in the prevalence of obesity has spread all over China, except for the poverty western rural areas. In 2005, the prevalence of combined childhood overweight and obesity in China reached 32.5\% for males and 17.6\% for females in the northern coastal big cities, suggesting that the obesity prevalence in some urban Chinese populations has approached that of the developed countries. The prevalence of obesity in the affluent rural sub-populations first exceeded that in some urban populations; then, as they learned their lessons and revised their lifestyles, the prevalence declined to a lower level approaching that of the transitional societies of other countries. The geographical distribution of obesity prevalence in China is mainly caused by the large disparity in the socioeconomic status related to dietary and lifestyle changes in modern China. Multiple and integrated interventions are urgently needed to halt the epidemic of childhood obesity by tackling its basic causes such as fast food, automobiles, television and lack of exercise. The differing prevalences in different regions of China offer an opportunity to reverse this alarming, growing epidemic of childhood obesity in the world's most populous country. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

First, the size of technological differences between FDI and Mexican firms is positively related to positive externalities, indicating the importance of sufficient scope of potential externalities, incentives to make externality-facilitating investments and the absence of negative competition effects. Second, geographical concentration is identified as a structural determinant of positive FDI externalities. Finally, the effect from FDI cleared from the influence of technological differences and agglomeration is the creation of positive externalities, especially when endogeneity of the foreign participation variable is controlled for. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: Standardised, cross-sectional nationally representative surveys conducted in 2010/2011 with 18 000 men and women aged 18 years and older in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia and Ukraine. Respondents were asked a range of questions on their knowledge of the health effects of tobacco and their support for a variety of tobacco control measures. Descriptive analysis was conducted on levels of knowledge and support, along with multivariate logistic regression analysis of characteristics associated with overall knowledge and support scores. RESULTS: Large gaps exist in public understanding of the negative health effects of tobacco use, particularly in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Moldova. There are also extremely high levels of misunderstanding about the potential effects of 'light' cigarettes. However, there is popular support for tobacco control measures. Over three quarters of the respondents felt that their governments could be more effective in pursuing tobacco control. Higher levels of education, social capital (membership of an organisation) and being a former or never-smoker were associated with higher knowledge on the health effects of tobacco and/or being more supportive of tobacco control measures. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing public awareness of tobacco's health effects is essential for informed decision-making by individuals and for further increasing public support for tobacco control measures.},

These aspects include social capital, income inequality, wealth, governance by regional health authorities and population health, the primary dependent variable. The social capital index incorporated associational and civic participation, average and median household incomes served as proxies for wealth, the degree of skew in the distribution of household incomes assessed income inequality while the model for effective governance by District Health Boards (DHBs) focused on reflection of health needs, policy making and implementation, fiscal responsibility and the integration and co-ordination of services. I found no evidence of a relationship between social capital in health districts and the performance of DHBs. Among the determinants of health, wealth appeared unrelated to age-standardised mortality rates while income inequality was positively and social capital was negatively related to mortality. Income inequality was not as strongly related to age-standardised mortality after controlling for social capital. and vice versa, suggesting the two may be comingled somehow when it comes to population health, although they were not significantly related to one another. Of the predictors of social capital the distribution of age in districts appeared to be the most salient; of the predictors of age-standardised mortality rates the gender composition of a district was most salient.},

By structurally relying on debt for the funding of their operations, firms operating in externally dependent (ED) sectors in OECD countries benefit from the tax shield provided by the tax-deductibility of debt interest payments. We conjecture that this tax advantage is likely to make them less sensitive to changes in home and host countries' corporate tax rates than firms in non-ED sectors when engaging in FDI. Using a new proprietary data on bilateral greenfield manufacturing FDI in OECD countries over the period 2003 to 2010, we find empirical support for this hypothesis as firms operating in externally dependent sectors appear to be much less sensitive to home and host corporate tax rates than firms operating in nonexternally dependent sectors.},

The resulting increases in levels of international trade and investment have subsequently generated research interest into the potential population health impact. We present a systematic review of quantitative studies investigating the relationship between international trade, foreign direct investment and non-nutritional health outcomes. Articles were systematically collected from the SCOPUS, PubMed, EconLit and Web of Science databases. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the evidence considered, the 16 included articles were subdivided into individual level data analyses, selected country analyses and international panel analyses. Articles were then quality assessed using a tool developed as part of the project. Nine of the studies were assessed to be high quality, six as medium quality, and one as low quality. The evidence from the quantitative literature suggests that overall, there appears to be a beneficial association between international trade and population health. There was also evidence of the importance of foreign direct investment, yet a lack of research considering the direction of causality. Taken together, quantitative research into the relationship between trade and non-nutritional health indicates trade to be beneficial, yet this body of research is still in its infancy. Future quantitative studies based on this foundation will provide a stronger basis on which to inform relevant national and international institutions about the health consequences of trade policies.},

Among women, smoking is much more common among the young (27\% in those aged 18-34) than among the middle-aged and elderly (5\% in those aged 55 and older), and more common among those living in urban areas than in rural areas. Smoking is also more common among men and women suffering material deprivation but there is no independent association with education.

Even though trade liberalisation seems to have positive effects on economic growth, it is not sufficient to boost growth. In several countries, trade reforms have not translated into enhanced economic expansion because complementary policies are needed. Trade liberalisation and openness are associated with greater wage inequality and raised economic insecurity. Trade liberalisation has facilitated availability of highly processed, calorie-rich, nutrient-poor food in developing countries, but further research is needed to better understand the effects of trade on unhealthy diets.

It should be noted, however, that the second result refers only to the marginal impact, not the total impact. Apart from FDI, our empirical evidence suggests that the level of economic development, the direct role of government and, to a smaller degree, the significance of the agriculture sector in an LDC are crucial determinants of income inequality.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Secondary data analysis of National Family Health Survey-3 (NFHS-3) was undertaken to study demographical variations in tobacco use between urban slum dwellers and non-slum dwellers in eight Indian cities. Demographic determinants for use of smoking and chewing forms of tobacco in the two groups were analyzed. SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis. RESULT: The study population comprised 6887 (41.8\%) males from slum areas and 9588 (58.2\%) from non-slum areas of eight urban cities. Cigarette/beedi smoking was the commonest form of tobacco use among the study population. Pan masala use was the least common form of smokeless tobacco use, next only to snuff. There was a high statistical significance observed within the various demographic parameter studied in both the slum and non-slum dwelling males in study population. However, on studying the differences between the two groups, it was observed that statistical significance of P{\textbackslash}textless/=.001 was observed with age (15-49), secondary education, religion, household structure and marital status. The difference between the two groups in the mean number of cigarettes/beedis smoked was not statistically significant (P=.598). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Male slum dwellers are a distinct urban population, whose health needs assessment requires a different approach than that for non-slum dwellers who often can afford the services that an urban Indian city can offer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:There are growing concerns regarding inequities in health, with poverty being an important determinant of health as well as a product of health status. Within the People's Republic of China (P.R. China), disparities in socio-economic position are apparent, with the rural-urban gap of particular concern. Our aim was to compare direct and proxy methods of estimating household wealth in a rural and a peri-urban setting of Hunan province, P.R. China.METHODS:We collected data on ownership of household durable assets, housing characteristics, and utility and sanitation variables in two village-wide surveys in Hunan province. We employed principal components analysis (PCA) and principal axis factoring (PAF) to generate household asset-based proxy wealth indices. Households were grouped into quartiles, from 'most wealthy' to 'most poor'. We compared the estimated household wealth for each approach. Asset-based proxy wealth indices were compared to those based on self-reported average annual income and savings at the household level.RESULTS:Spearman's rank correlation analysis revealed that PCA and PAF yielded similar results, indicating that either approach may be used for estimating household wealth. In both settings investigated, the two indices were significantly associated with self-reported average annual income and combined income and savings, but not with savings alone. However, low correlation coefficients between the proxy and direct measures of wealth indicated that they are not complementary. We found wide disparities in ownership of household durable assets, and utility and sanitation variables, within and between settings.CONCLUSION:PCA and PAF yielded almost identical results and generated robust proxy wealth indices and categories. Pooled data from the rural and peri-urban settings highlighted structural differences in wealth, most likely a result of localized urbanization and modernization. Further research is needed to improve measurements of wealth in low-income and transitional country contexts.},

Using econometric models of repeated cross-sectional data on diabetes and nutritional components of food from 175 countries, we found that every 150 kcal/person/day increase in sugar availability (about one can of soda/day) was associated with increased diabetes prevalence by 1.1\{\%\} (p \{\&\}lt;0.001) after testing for potential selection biases and controlling for other food types (including fibers, meats, fruits, oils, cereals), total calories, overweight and obesity, period-effects, and several socioeconomic variables such as aging, urbanization and income. No other food types yielded significant individual associations with diabetes prevalence after controlling for obesity and other confounders. The impact of sugar on diabetes was independent of sedentary behavior and alcohol use, and the effect was modified but not confounded by obesity or overweight. Duration and degree of sugar exposure correlated significantly with diabetes prevalence in a dose-dependent manner, while declines in sugar exposure correlated with significant subsequent declines in diabetes rates independently of other socioeconomic, dietary and obesity prevalence changes. Differences in sugar availability statistically explain variations in diabetes prevalence rates at a population level that are not explained by physical activity, overweight or obesity.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

Strategies for preventing childhood obesity are suggested. Methods We used a dataset provided by the Chinese National Survey on Students' Constitution and Health from 1985‐2010. Subjects were 7‐18‐year‐old students randomly selected from urban and rural areas in 30 provinces. Eight subgroups were created according to region and socioeconomic status. Results Increased rates of the epidemic (overweight and obesity combined) were greatest in large coastal cities‐32.6\% and 19.1\% among males and females, respectively. These rates has neared that of developed countries. Similar increases were found in all other regions, including the once poverty‐stricken rural west. The epidemic in most of the rural areas began after 2000, but has spread swiftly over the last decade. In 2010, it was estimated that 9.9\% of Chinese school‐aged children and adolescents were overweight and that an additional 5.1\% were obese, representing an estimated 30.43 million individuals. Conclusion The prognosis for China's childhood‐obesity epidemic is dire.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To explore how British American Tobacco (BAT), having established cigarette imports, responded to the opportunities for investment in cigarette manufacturing in the former Soviet Union (FSU). DESIGN: Analysis of documents held at the BAT archive in Guildford, UK. RESULTS: Considerable priority was attached to investing in the FSU. This led BAT to undertake a major organisational change and to intense competition to acquire assets. BAT used flawed economic arguments to persuade cash starved governments that its investment would reap economic rewards. It offered excise advice that disadvantaged governments while benefiting BAT, confused issues over pricing, and avoided competitive tendering. BAT targeted agriculture ministries, using its expertise in leaf production to differentiate itself from other potential investors. It subverted the principles of corporate social responsibility to promote itself as a business partner. BAT's task was made easier by the naivety of post-Soviet governments and by the international financial organisations' support for rapid economic reform. The latter permitted tobacco transnationals to penetrate markets before effective competitive tendering processes had been established, giving them the opportunity to minimise prices and establish monopolies. CONCLUSIONS: Many of the arguments employed when penetrating post-Soviet markets were highly misleading but governments lacked expertise to realise this. There is a need to build tobacco control capacity in transition economies, within and outside government, to ensure that governments are better informed of the true economic and health impacts of tobacco. Rapid transition from socialist to market economies without establishing regulatory institutional structures may be dangerous when investing companies use business practices that fall short of international standards.},

The results imply that in seeking to promote a dynamic competitive advantage in the home country, governments need to pay more attention to their macroeconomic policies to help fashion and reduce production and transaction costs of MNEs.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To study different socioeconomic determinants of mortality in posttransition Russia and propose potential explanations. Previous research has demonstrated a widening educational mortality gradient, widespread deprivation, and harmful health behaviors. Methods: Data were from seven rounds (1994-2002) of the 38-center Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey. We measured associations among education, income, consumer goods, smoking, alcohol consumption, and subsequent death (reported by another household member), using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis. Results: There were 11,482 adults older than 18 years, 782 deaths, and a mean follow-up of 4.2 years. Study and national mortality rates were comparable (standardized mortality ratio of 0.96 in men and 0.78 in women). Education predicted mortality strongly: the fully adjusted hazard ratios for less than secondary compared with higher education were 1.68 (1.26-2.23) in men and 3.08 (2.25-4.21) in women. Income and material measures did not predict mortality strongly. Smoking and weekly drinking independently doubled the mortality risk; however, like income, they did not explain the educational mortality gradient, of which material measures accounted for one-third in men only. Conclusions: Education, unlike material advantage, protected strongly against mortality. Education may better reflect lifetime health-related exposures, although other explanations (e.g., psychosocial, cardiovascular risk) deserve further research. Health behaviors exhibited strong, separate effects on mortality. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We find strong evidence of positive spatial dependence between Chinese prefectures after 1991. Apart from the usual divergence conclusions, we find evidence for significant conditional convergence force when the spatial spillover effects are controlled. Our results also indicate the competition effect of capital accumulation and urbanization growth among neighboring regions. Moreover, spatial convergence clubs are detected and the spatial interactions and growth behavior varies. ?? 2010.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: With China's rapid economic development, the disease burden may have changed in the country. We studied the major causes of death and modifiable risk factors in a nationally representative cohort of 169,871 men and women 40 years of age and older in China. METHODS: Baseline data on the participants' demographic characteristics, medical history, lifestyle-related risk factors, blood pressure, and body weight were obtained in 1991 with the use of a standard protocol. The follow-up evaluation was conducted in 1999 and 2000, with a follow-up rate of 93.4 percent. RESULTS: We documented 20,033 deaths in 1,239,191 person-years of follow-up. The mortality from all causes was 1480.1 per 100,000 person-years among men and 1190.2 per 100,000 person-years among women. The five leading causes of death were malignant neoplasms (mortality, 374.1 per 100,000 person-years), diseases of the heart (319.1), cerebrovascular disease (310.5), accidents (54.0), and infectious diseases (50.5) among men and diseases of the heart (268.5), cerebrovascular disease (242.3), malignant neoplasms (214.1), pneumonia and influenza (45.9), and infectious diseases (35.3) among women. The multivariate-adjusted relative risk of death and the population attributable risk for preventable risk factors were as follows: hypertension, 1.48 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.44 to 1.53) and 11.7 percent, respectively; cigarette smoking, 1.23 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.18 to 1.27) and 7.9 percent; physical inactivity, 1.20 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.16 to 1.24) and 6.8 percent; and underweight (body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters] below 18.5), 1.47 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.42 to 1.53) and 5.2 percent. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular disease and cancer have become the leading causes of death among Chinese adults. Our findings suggest that control of hypertension, smoking cessation, increased physical activity, and improved nutrition should be important strategies for reducing the burden of premature death among adults in China.},

Do the health advantages of high educational attainment and disadvantages of low educational attainment diverge or converge with age? The cumulative advantage perspective predicts a diverging SES gap in health with age, but past evidence does not allow us to accept or reject the hypothesis. We address this issue in two samples, cross-sectionally and over time, with three health measures. The first data set consists of a 1990 telephone interview of a national probability sample of U.S. households. There are 2,031 respondents, aged 18 to 90. The second is a national probability sample of U.S. households in which 2,436 respondents aged 20 to 64 were interviewed by telephone in 1979 and reinterviewed in 1980. We find that the gap in self-reported health, in physical functioning, and in physical well-being among people with high and low educational attainment increases with age. The health advantage of the well educated is larger in older age groups than in younger. Health advantages of high income and disadvantages of low income also diverge with age, but household income does not explain education's positive effect.},

Third, two measures of market potential are constructed and a spatial error model is adopted to obtain the estimations, considering spatial autocorrelation. Controlling for major inputs, such as labor, capital, and human capital, the market potential continues to promote substantial regional growth. On average, an increase of 10 percentage points in the market potential increases the regional GDP per capita growth by 3-5 percentage points.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the past two decades, China has enjoyed impressive economic development, and her citizens have experienced many remarked changes in their lifestyle. These changes are often associated with an increase in obesity and chronic disease. METHODS: In this meta-analysis, based on nationally representative data, we studied the current prevalence of obesity and the trends in obesity, mortality and morbidity in China. RESULTS: Between 1992 and 2002, the prevalence of overweight and obesity increased in all gender and age groups and in all geographic areas. Using the World Health Organization body mass index cut points, the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity increased from 14.6 to 21.8\%. The Chinese obesity standard shows an increase from 20.0 to 29.9\%. The annual increase rate was highest in men aged 18-44 years and women aged 45-59 years (approximately 1.6 and 1.0\% points, respectively). In general, male subjects, urban residents, and high-income groups had a greater increase. With the increase in overweight and obesity, obesity-, and diet-related chronic diseases (e.g., hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and type 2 diabetes) also increased over the past decade and became a more important preventable cause of death. Hypertension increased from 14.4\% in 1991 to 18.8\% in 2002 in adults; in older adults aged 35-74 years, it increased from 19.7 to 28.6\%. Between 1993 and 2003, the prevalence of CVD increased from 31.4 to 50.0\%; diabetes increased from 1.9 to 5.6\%. During 1990-2003, although total mortality rate (per 100 000) decreased, overall the mortality rate and contribution (as percentages) to total death of obesity-related chronic disease increased, in particular, in rural areas. Mortality rate (per 100 000) of CVD increased from 128 to 145 and its contribution to total death, 27 to 32\%, in rural areas; the figures decreased slightly in urban areas. The mortality rate of 'nutrition, endocrinology and metabolism-related disease' (NEMD) increased in both rural and urban areas between 1990 and 2000, 8.0 to 10.6 and 4.9 to 5.3, respectively. The current prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidaemia, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes among Chinese adults is approximately 20, 20, 15, and 3\%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of overweight and obesity and obesity-related chronic diseases have increased in China in the past decade. Our findings provide useful information for the projection of future trends and the formulation of national strategies and programmes that can address the challenges of the growing obesity and chronic disease epidemic.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the spread and sociodemographic correlates of smoking among low-income women in Aleppo, Syria. METHODS: A sample of 412 women was recruited from eight randomly selected primary care centres (total number 22) in Aleppo. The response rate was 97.2\%, the mean age of participants was 28 (+/- 8.4) years, and married women constituted 88.3\% of those studied. A special questionnaire was prepared for study purposes, and interviews were conducted in an anonymous, one-to-one fashion. RESULTS: Current smoking and daily smoking were found among respectively 16.5\% and 7.5\% of those investigated. Smokers were older, economically better off and came from smaller households (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05 for all) than non-smokers. They also were more likely to be non-Arabs, Christians, and city residents than nonsmokers (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05 for all). Mental morbidity and physical abuse were both associated with smoking among those investigated (P {\textbackslash}textless or = 0.05). Smokers among married women were more likely to marry later, to marry a nonrelative, to be older at the birth of their first child, and were less likely to live with members of their husband's family (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05 for all). Multivariate predictors of smoking status among married women were race, residence, household, consanguinity, working, mental morbidity and physical abuse. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the level of smoking among poor women in this society is still low compared to that of men, but it is higher than that of women in other social strata studied.

In order to detect specifics of development of main economic activities, differences in structure of FDI and structure of GDP of host economy are being juxtaposed, FDI intensity indicator in main economic activities elaborated. Authors test if different levels of penetration of foreign capital into certain economic activities serve as important factor affecting their economic growth. Research is being developed further by making assumption about higher concentration of FDI intensive economic activities. Higher concentration in that context would be interpreted as possible crowding out of local business firms from FDI intensive industries.},

	abstract = {Socio-economic differentials in health in Russia are not well understood and the life course approach has been relatively neglected. This paper examines the influence of socio-economic risk factors over the life course on the self-rated health of older Russian men and women. A random sample (response rate 61\%) of the general population of the Russian Federation in 2002 included 1004 men and 1930 women aged 50 years and over in a cross-sectional study. They provided information concerning their childhood circumstances, including going to bed hungry; education; current social conditions, including per capita household income; health behaviours and self-rated health. There was considerable tracking of adverse social conditions across the life course with men and women who reported hunger in childhood having lower educational achievements, and current household income was strongly influenced by educational attainment. The effect of these socio-economic risk factors on health accumulated with an odds ratio of poor health of 1.87 [1.07-3.28] for men with one risk factor, 3.64 [2.13-6.22] for two risk factors and 4.51 [2.57-7.91] for all three compared to men with no risk factors. For women, the odds ratios were 1.44 [1.05-2.01], 2.88 [2.10-3.93] and 4.27 [3.03-6.00] for one, two and three risk factors, respectively. Current income was the strongest individual predictor for men, and education for women. Adjustment for health behaviours reduced the odds ratios only marginally. The results suggest that self-rated health in older Russians reflects social exposures accumulated over the life course, with the differentials observed only partially explained by current social conditions. Health behaviours were not involved in mediating social differences in self-rated health. Our results indicate that a life course approach may contribute to the understanding of health in Russia.},
